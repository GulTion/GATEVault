Suppose thatX is a strict superset of Y (this means that all the attributes in Y appear in X,and X contains attributes that do not appear in Y).Consider the following two statements S1: If Y is a key, then'is X a key S2: if X is a key, is Y a key as well Which of the following two statements is /are true? (a) Only S1 (b)Only S2 (c) Both S1and S2 (d) neither S1 nor S2 Answer - (d) S1:IF x is a strict superset of Y it means X contain more attribute, so if Y is a key so X will be super key not a candidate key (key). S2 : IF X is/a key then Y is a key as well False, because X is a superset of Y .Y may or may not be akey.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
