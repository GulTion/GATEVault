So, we can choose the 2 elements from the vertex v in kC2 ways, and, for each of these 2 er elements pair, say {a,, a]}, vertex v can have an edge to all vertices which are subset of (S—v),U{as,a;} . First we find the subsets of S-v, and then put elments a; and a; into it. This will be equal to on—k possible subsets as the 2 common elements must always be present and other k elements must always be absent. So, we get the degree as ¥ x 27*. Now, our answer will be the maximum value for this. We can differentiate this (w.r.t. k) and equate to 0. But in other way we can try different values for k starting with 2. As we see if we increase k from 2 on wards, the 2\"~ term gets divided by 2. The other term is *C'y, which goes like 1,3,6,10,... for k=2,3,4,5,....So, we get the max. degree for k = 3 or 4 and this will be 3 x 2\"~3.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
