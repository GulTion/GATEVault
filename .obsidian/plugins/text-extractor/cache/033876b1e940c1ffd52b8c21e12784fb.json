The processes arrive in the order P, Q, R, S, all at time t = 0. There is exactly one context switch from S to Q, exactly one context switch from R to Q, and exactly two context switches from Q to R. There is no context switch from S to P. Switching to a ready process after the termination of another process is also considered a context switch. Which one of the following is NOT possible as CPU burst time (in time units) of these processes? e P=4,Q=10,R=6,5=2 e P=2,Q=9,R=5:S=1 X P=4,Q=12,R=5/S=4 J P=3,Q=7,R=7,5S=3 GATE CSE 2022 CPU Scheduling","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
