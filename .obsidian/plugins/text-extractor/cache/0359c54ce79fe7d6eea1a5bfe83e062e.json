It means at least one function is oscillatory. For example: Let f(n) = n*-s»® and g(n) = n°5. We know that the range of sin (n) is between -1 to 1. So, when sin (n) = 0.4 then f(n) = n®¢ and g(n) = n®3i.e., f{(n)> g(n). When sin (n) = 0.6 then f(n) = n®* and g(n) = n%1i.e., f(n)< g(n). So, in this case we cannot say F(n) = O(G(n)) or G(n) = O(F(n)).","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
