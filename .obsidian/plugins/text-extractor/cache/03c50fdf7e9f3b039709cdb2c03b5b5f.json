Time to transfer one page to/from disk: 5000 ns 4.TLB hit ratio: 0.95 5. Page fault rate: 0.10 6. 20 % of page faults need to be written back to disk Hence, effective memory access time = 0.95%(20+100) + 0.05*(20+100+100) + 0.1*5000 + 0.1*0.2*5000 =725.0ns When finding effective memory access time in TLB with page faults, first find TLB lookup time in case of TLB hit and TLB miss, then the time due to page fault. Here 20% of the page faults are causing dirty pages so we have to also consider that.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
