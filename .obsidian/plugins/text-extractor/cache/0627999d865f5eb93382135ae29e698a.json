They give the visitor three CAPTCHA tests that are hard for robots, but easy for humans. If the visitor fails in one of the tests, they are flagged as a robot. The probability that a human succeeds at a single test is 0.95, while a robot only succeeds with probability 0.4. Assume all tests are independent. If a robot visits the website, what is the probability they get flagged?","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
