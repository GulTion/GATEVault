Each stage of the pipeline, except the EX stage, takes one cycle. Assume that the ID stage merely decodes the instruction and the register read is performed in the EX stage. The EX stage takes one cycle for ADD instruction and the register read is performed in the EX stage, The EX stage takes one cycle for ADD instruction and two cycles for MUL instruction. Ignore pipeline register latencies. Consider the following sequence of 8 instructions: ADD, MUL, ADD, MUL, ADD, MUL, ADD, MUL Assume that every MUL instruction is data-dependent on the ADD instruction just before it and every ADD instruction (except the first ADD) is data-dependent on the MUL instruction just before it. The speedup defined as follows. . Execution time without operand forwarding Speedup = —————— Execution time with operand forearding The Speedup achieved in executing the given instruction sequence on the pipelined processor (rounded to 2 decimal places) is 0 2.58 e 6.37 X 1.45 J 1.87 GATE CSE 2021 SET-2 Computer Organization","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
