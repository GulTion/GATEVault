No write back is done here, as in a write through L1 cache, both L1 and L2 caches are updated during a write operation (no dirty blocks 13 and hence no dirty bits as in a write back cache). So during a Read miss it will simply bring in the missed @ block from L2 to L1 which may replace one block in L1 (this replaced block in L1 is already updated in L2 and so needs no write back). So, S; is TRUE. S5 : This statement is FALSE. Both write-through and write-back policies can use either of these write- Best . I PR answer Miss policies, but usually they are paired in this way. « No write allocation during write through as L1 and L2 are accessed for each write operation (subsequent writes to same location gives no advantage even if the location is in L1 cache). « In write back we can to do write allocate in L1 after a write operation hoping for subsequent writes to the same location which will then hit in L1 and thus avoiding a more expensive L2 access.
