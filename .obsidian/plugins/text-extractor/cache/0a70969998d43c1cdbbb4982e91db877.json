Consider the group (Z, +), of all integers with respect to the operation addition. The subset H of all integral multiples of 3 is a subgroup. The subset K of all integral multiples of 5 is a subgroup. But HUK is not a subgroup since closure property is not satisfied. Note that 3eHUK and 5eHUK but 3+5=8Â¢HUK. This example proves that union of two subgroups need not be a subgroup. (b) The intersection of two sub group of group is also a group. This is a known property. o It is true. (c) True, The subgroup of an abelian group is always abelian (d) False","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
