Now process P2 get a chance and execute Wait(q), which set q = 0 and print +, then process P2 get time out and again process P1 get chance and execute print (-), then process P1 get timeout and process P2 get a chance and print (-). So P1 and P2 print + + — —. After printing both execute signal(q). Now q = 2 and process P3 get executed and executed print (+) and print (-), then process P4 get executed and print (+) and print (-). So possible substring + + - —+ — + — So, option 1 is possible output. Option (b): Process P1 get a chance and set q = 1, and print +. Now process P1 get time out and now process P2 get a chance and set q = 0 and print + now process 2 print — and signal q. Now value of q = 1. Process 3 get a chance and set q = 0 and print +, - and signal (q), q = 1. Now process 4 get a chance and q = 0 and print +, -. Now process 1 again get a chance and print -. So possible substring + + —+ -+ — —","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
