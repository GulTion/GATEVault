And we know that constant of Variance is 0. So, V (a + b) = 0. V(aX + bY) = a2V(X) + b2V(Y) + 2ab Cov (X, Y) = 2?V(X) + b2V(Y) [As, C(X, Y) = 0.] + X is not independent of X, hence E(X?) = [E(X)2 Therefore, E(X2Y2) = [EX)P[E(Y)? So, options (a), (b) and (c) are correct.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
