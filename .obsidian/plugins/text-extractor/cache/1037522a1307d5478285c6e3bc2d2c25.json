Hence the child process and parent process do not share any variable including global .so this statement is false. Statement 2: Fork () creates a child process with completely new address space and hence they do not share address space. The virtual addresses may look the same. However, their physical addresses in the memory are different .so this statement is false. Statement3: Child process can terminate on its own .so this statement is false. Statement4: Since the parent can terminate on its own without notifying child process .so child process terminated on its own. Therefore, this statement is false. Statement 5: Fork () returns process id of child to parent not parent process id to child therefore this statement is also false.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
