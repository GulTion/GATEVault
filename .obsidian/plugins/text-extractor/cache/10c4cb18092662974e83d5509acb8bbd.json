We want to have as minimum nodes as possible with such height. A oot or any node has exactly 3 children. So, there are 3 subtrees, what should be the height of each subtree? Since we want to put minimum nodes hence we would like to have minimum heights too. The height of at least one subtree at the root should be h — 1 otherwise total height will be lesser than h. Hence the height of one subtree will be b — 1 Height of other subtrees = h — 2 h h-2 h-2 h-1 T(h) = T(h — 1) + 2T(h — 2) 4 1 (We are adding one because the root is also one node.) Suppose they ask about the maximum number of nodes, then we should have maximum heights everywhere and the answer would be T'(h) = 3T(h — 1) 4 1.","libVersion":"0.2.4","langs":"eng"}
