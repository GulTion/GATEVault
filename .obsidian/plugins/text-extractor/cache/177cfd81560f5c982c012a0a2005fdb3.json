When the sender receives a (positive) acknowledgement for the lowest-numbered (oldest) packet it sent that has not yet been acknowledged, which of the following actions is/are among those it will take? (a) It transmits the packet with the next larger sequence number. (b) It “slides” its window up, so the lower end of the window just includes the lowest numbered packet it sent (or is allowed to send). (c) It retransmits the packet with the next larger sequence number, if it had already been transmitted. (D) It “shrinks” its window by one sequence number.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
