A block pointer is PB = 5 bytes long, and a record pointer is PR = 7 bytes long. A file has r = 350,000 EMPLOYEE records of fixed length. The size of each record is 100 bytes. Suppose the file is not ordered by the key field SSN (9 bytes) and we want to construct a multilevel index on SSN. To access a record by searching the multilevel index, we need to access total number of blocks","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
