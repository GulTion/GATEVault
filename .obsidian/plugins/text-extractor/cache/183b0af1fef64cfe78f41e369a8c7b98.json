Now, these 10 bits along with 32 bit globally unique IP address will give a globally unique 42 bit IDs which stays constant. Since we are allowed 50 bits we can use the next 8 bits using the clock which changes every second. Thus our IDs will wrap around once in 28 = 256 seconds. B","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
