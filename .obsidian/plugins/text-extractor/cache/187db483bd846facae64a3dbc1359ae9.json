Here, 2 € G and Order (2) =2, But2#4 (b) Here, 26 = 0 = identity But, neither 4% 6 =0nor 6% 4 =0 If the option had been, K % m=0orn% m=0 Then it would had been true (where m = order (a)) For this example, m = 2 n%m=0 This comes directly from the property of group that order of element of the group, divides Order of the group. It is false. (<) This will be always True, As due to the property stated above n=mxandsincear=e=am™=e=a\"=e (where m = order (a)) (d) an = e and a* = e (given) So, yes their order will be same and equal to 1.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
