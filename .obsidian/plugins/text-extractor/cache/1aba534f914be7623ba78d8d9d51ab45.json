You have to compute A1A2A3A4 in such a way so that minimum numbers of multiplications are required. Suppose you are solving this problem by Dynamic programming approach. For 1< i< j < 4, let m[i, j| be denote the minimum number of multiplications needed to compute A;._;. The optimum cost can be described by the following recursive definition: mli, j] = { O. : .
