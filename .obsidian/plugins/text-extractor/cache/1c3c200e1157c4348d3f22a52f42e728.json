For example, Let identity = a1 and let a; = a» Now among remaining 10elements (a3, as . . . an), 5 pairs will be formed of an elements ax And it’s inverse. example: (a3) = ay, (as)! = ag, (a7)! = as, (as)! = ao, (a11)! = a1» can be such possibility. Note that there can be various such possibilities, but every single order of them have 5 pairs like (ax (ax)?), finally the question ask the order of: (a1. @2. @3. as. as . as. a7. as. a9 . 410 . 11 . a12) Here (as.as.a5.a6.a7.as.a9. a0 . a1 . ap) =e.e. e.e.e=e [as graph is Abelian, it is Associative & Commutative, So we will multiply an element and its inverse together] Now, (a1. a2. @3. as. as . as. a7. ag . a9 . a10 . a11 . an2) = (a1. az. e) = (a1. a2) = a» [.. a1 was assumed to be identity ] So, basically, the whole question reduces to finding the order of as, And since; as we assumed initially, a; is its own inverse, its order will be 2, as a». a» = e or (a2)2 =2","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
