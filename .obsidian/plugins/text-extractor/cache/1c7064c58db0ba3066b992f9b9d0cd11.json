So, A is not invertible. Also, A has not 49 linearly independent eigenvectors. Since rank of diagonal matrix is number of non-zero diagonal element hence Rank of A = 49 — 16 = 33. Also, Rank of A2 = 33, because the diagonal elements of A2 are square of the diagonal element of the A. Hence, Rank of A2= Rank of A. Trace of A={7 + 13 + 19+ 25+ ... + 97} + (4 + 7 + 10 + 13 + ...48 + 52} =§ [2x7+15><6]+177[2><4+16><3]=(8><104)+(17><28)=832+476=1308.
