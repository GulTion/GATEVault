A dynamic program for solving this problem uses a 2-dimensional Boolean array, X, with n rows and W+1 columns. For 1<i<n, 0<j<W, X [i, j|] is TRUE if and only if there is a subset of {al , a2 ,..., ai} whose elements sum to j. For the set S ={1, 2, 3,4, 5, 6,7, 8 and subset sum W = 11, if P true entries are in (W + 1)t column and Q false entries are in (W â€” 4)th column of the table. Then what is the value of (P + Q)?","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
