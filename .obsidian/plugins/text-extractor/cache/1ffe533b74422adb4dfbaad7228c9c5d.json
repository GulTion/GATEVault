We can proof this by contradiction. Proof: Given that P (A) is infinite. Let A is finite then P(A) is also finite. Therefore, our assumption is wrong. So, we can say that if P (A) is infinite, then A must also be infinite. (b) For all sets A and B, if there is a surjection from A to B and A is countable, then B is countable. This is also true because given that there is a surjection from A to B. Therefore, | A|>=|B|. Since A is countable, hence B is definitely countable. (c) If R is a symmetric relation on the set A, then (A x A) — R must also be a symmetric relation on A. This is also true because complement of symmetric relation is always symmetric. (d)For all sets A, B, and C, if ANBNC = @ then {A, B, C} is pairwise disjoint. This is false when A = {1, 2}, B = {2, 3} and C = {1, 3}. In this case ANBNC = @ but ANB * @.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
