Now, with 4 vertices, we can form only 3 distinct cycles. [See below] So, total no. of distinct cycles of length 4 = 15 x 3 = 45. No. of cyclic permutations of n objects = (n — 1)! and forn = 4, we get 3! = 6 ways. But number of distinct cycles in a graph is exactly half the number of cyclic permutations as there is no left/right ordering in a graph. For example a — b — ¢ — dand a — d — ¢ — b are different permutations but in a graph they form the same cycle. Since, 45 was not in the choice, marks were given to all in GATE.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
