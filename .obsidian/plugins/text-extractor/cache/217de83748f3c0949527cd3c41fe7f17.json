Ethernet may carry data upto 512 byte (i.e. MTU = 512 B). Find the number of payload bytes in last fragment. Solution : 404 f—————— 1400 B ——————— Fragment size = 512 - 20 (Header) = 492 (Not divisible by 8) So, max data possible = 488 bytes 1380 So, number of fragments = [ —]: 3 488 Fragment offset, For 1*! fragment = 0 containing 488 byte 27d fragment = 488 containing 488 bytes 34 fragment = 976 containing 404 bytes So, last fragment contain = 404 bytes","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
