So, probability of choosing red ball in (i + 1) iteration will be : =2 ) So, Probability of choosing red ball in (i + 2) iteration will be : (note that, in (i -+ 1) iteration, we could either pick black or red ball. ) +1 b 748 X TibiT s X Tibe =2 = b So, in the beginning we have 7 red balls, and b green balls. So, in every iteration, the probability of choosing a red ball will be . A beautiful question!! Whatever iteration we take, even in 100y, iteration, probability of picking a red ball RIS Refer following link.
