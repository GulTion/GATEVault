Therefore, 2/12/4 = 2710 rows need 10 bits to be indexed. Since the computer is byte-addressable, the bits of offset is log2 (274B) = 4. And the tag bits are calculated as: 32 - 10 - 4 = 18 bits. The total size of the cache including data and all the metadata is = (18 Tag bits + 16 » 8 Data bits + 1 Valid bit + 1 Dirty bit + 2 LRU bits) » 212 = 614400 bits = 614400/8 bits = 76800 bytes = 75KB","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
