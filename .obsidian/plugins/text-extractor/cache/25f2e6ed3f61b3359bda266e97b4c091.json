Given an array as input, RumbleSort attempts to sort the array and produces a sorted array as output.Hereâ€™s the pseudocode for RumbleSort. RumbleSort(L): let sorted = false while not sorted: sorted = true fori:=0;i<len(L) -2; i++: if L[i] > L[i + 2] sorted = false reverse the given list from L[i] to L[i + 2] (inclusive) Consider running RumbleSort on the following inputs.
