So, it accepts the language (ab + aba)*. Since we know that (0*1%)* = (0 + 1J*, hence ((ab)*(aba)*)* = (ab + aba)*. So, option (a) & (c) are correct. Option (b) is incorrect because the string ‘b’ is not accepted by given DFA. Since (0% + 1%)* = (0 + 1)*, hence ((ab)* + (aba)*)* = (ab + aba)*. Also, aba(ba)* belongs to (ab + aba)*, as aba(ba)* = {aba, ababa, abababa, ababababa -..} So, Option (d) is correct.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
