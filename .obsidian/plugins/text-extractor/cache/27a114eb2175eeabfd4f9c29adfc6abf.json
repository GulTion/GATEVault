To specify a new IP address and port 2. To unconnect the socket The first case specifying a new peer for a connected UDP socket differs from the use of connect with a TCP socket. Connect can be called only one time for a TCP socket. To unconnect a UDP socket. we call Connect but set the family member of the socket address structure to AT_UNSPEC. Also, a UDP client or server can call Connect only if that process uses the UDP socket to communicate with exactly one peer. So, option B should be the answer.
