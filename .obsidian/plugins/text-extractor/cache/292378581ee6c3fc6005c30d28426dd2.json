So, In every second system is conducting polls for 100 times. For each poll it is consuming 100 microsec. So, for 100 pools it will consumes : 100 * 100 microsec = 10000 microsec. Now, it is saying that system consumes 200 mircosec to process the keystroke and It is mentioned in the question that keyboard is type at speed of 1 keystroke/sec, which means it will consume only 200 microsec only.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
