It describes the desired information without giving a specific procedure for obtaining that information. The tuple relational calculus is specified to select the tuples in a relation. In TRC, filtering variable uses the tuples of a relation. The result of the relation can have one or more tuples. The Tuple Relational Caleulus tells what to do but never explains how to do. So Both S1 and S2 are true and S2 is the correct reason for S1.","libVersion":"0.2.4","langs":"eng"}
