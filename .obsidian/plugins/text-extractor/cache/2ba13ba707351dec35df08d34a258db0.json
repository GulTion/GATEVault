Case I: When size of three equivalence classes are 1, 2, 3. Cardinality of R = 12 + 22 + 32 = 14, Number of equivalence relations = 72 = 60 Case II: When size of three equivalence classes are 1, 1, 4. Cardinality of R = 12 + 12 + 42 = 18, Number of equivalence relations = ;% = 15 Case III: When size of three equivalence classes are 2, 2, 2. Cardinality of R = 22 + 22 + 22 = 12, Number of equivalence relations = 7%~ = 15 So, Total number of equivalence relation on S with three equivalence class = 60 + 15 + 15 = 90. Therefore option (¢ is true. Minimum cardinality of R is 12. Therefore option (a) is not true. Maximum cardinality of R is 18. Therefore option (b) is true. Option (d) is true, when R contains all and only self-pairs.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
