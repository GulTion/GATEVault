Now, Cuma = 2MSS 3nd RTT: Swnd = min(3, 2) = Swna = 2MSS So, 2MSS is sent. Now, Cuma = 4MSS 4tÂ» RTT:- Swna = min(3, 4) = 3MSS So, 3MSS is sent Now, Size of Rwnd is less than Cwnd, so know onwards sender windows size is always equals to 3MSS. 5th RTT:- Swna = 3MSS So, 3MSS is sent. Till now, 1 +2 + 3 + 3 = 9 MSS is sent. We have to send 3MSS more. 6t RTT:- Swna = 3MSS So, now all 12 MSS is sent and 5 RTT are required to send these plus 1 for the connection establishment So, answer = 6R Correct answer is (c)","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
