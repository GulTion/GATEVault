FCFS: from 0 — 10 : process 1 from 10 — 20 : process 2 , from 100 — 110 : process 1 from 110 — 120 : process 2 g So, in every 100 ms, CPU is utilized for 20 ms, CPU utilization = 20% SRTF: Same as FCFS as CPU burst time is same for all the processes Static priority scheduling: Suppose process 1 is having higher priority. Now, the scheduling will be same as FCFS. If process 2 is having higher priority, then the scheduling will be as FCFS with process 1 and process 2 interchanged. So, CPU utilization remains at 20% Round Robin: Time quantum given as 5 ms. from0 — 5 : process 1 from 5 — 10 : process 2 from 10 — 15 : process 1 from 15 — 20 : process 2 from 105 — 110: process 1 from 110 — 115 : process 2 So, in 105 ms, 20 ms of CPU burst is there. So, utilization = 20/105 = 19.05% 19.05 is less than 20, so answer is (D). (Round robin with time quantum 10ms would have made the CPU utilization same for all the schedules)","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
