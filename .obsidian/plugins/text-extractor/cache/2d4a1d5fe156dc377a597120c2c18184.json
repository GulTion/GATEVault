Z(4,B,C,D)=Ym(0,1,2,4,7,8,9, 10, 12, 15) Z(4, B, C, D) = ym(3, 5, 6, 11, 13, 14) = BCD' + BC'D + B'CD, (So, Z' is independent of A) which is exact function implement by G(B, C, D). So, if pass the input in G like G(G(B, C, D), 1, 1), then the output of G is equal to Z(4, B, C, D). Therefore, minimum two G gates are required.
