But, this causes partial FD A21 — A22 and makes the table not in 2N F'. In order to make the table in 2N F, we have to create a separate table for multi-valued attribute. Then we get T1: {A11, A12, A13}— keyis A1l T2 : {421, 422, A11}— keyis A21 T3 : {A21, A28} keyis {A21, A23} Here, all determinants of all FDs are keys and hence the relation is in BONE and so 3N F also. So, we need minimum 3 tables. Correct Answer: B PS: Even if \"3NF” isn't explicitly mentioned in question we should assume it and we cannot add NULL entries during ER to Relational conversion.
