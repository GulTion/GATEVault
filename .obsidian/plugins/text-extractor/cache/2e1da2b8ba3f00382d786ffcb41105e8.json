In other words, if a cache entry is valid, the cache will assume this entry is invalid with probability p. On the other hand, if the cache entry is invalid, the cache will correctly assume it is invalid. The memory access time is 40 ns, cache access time is 10ns, and probability of finding an entry in cache (before reading valid bit) is 0.9. If effective access time (after reading the valid bit) is 41 ns, what is the value of probability p (in percent)?","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
