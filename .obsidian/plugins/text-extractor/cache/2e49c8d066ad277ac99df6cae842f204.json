Actually because of multi level paging we increase no of memory accesses. B. It helps to reduce the size of page table needed to implement the virtual address space of a process -> This is true, In case of big virtual memory page, size of Page table can also be too huge to fit in single Page. So we do multi level paging. C. Itis required by the translation lookaside buffer.-> Examiner was not being enough creative here, This is false & There is no relation. This option is just given for no reason ! D. It helps to reduce the number of page faults in page replacement algorithms.-> This is false, we might increase no of page faults. (Due to second / third level page not in memory here !) So this is false.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
