It is not decidable. (b) L= {<G> |G is a CFG and L(G)=} } It is decidable, because we have an algorithm for this. If all production rules contains useless symbol. or all production rules of G is useless. Then L(G) =¢ () and (d) are undecidable. Because for this problem there doesn't exist any algorithm.
