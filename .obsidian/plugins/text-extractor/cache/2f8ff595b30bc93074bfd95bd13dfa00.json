So, option (d) is not possible sequence number. Since receiver transmits an ACK with sequence number 3, that means receiver has received frame with sequence number 0, 1 and 2. So this sequence number cannot be in the receiver window so option (a) is not possible. Since receiver transmits an ACK with sequence number 3, that also means the next 5 sequence number for which receiver is waiting are 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. So option (c) is also not possible.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
