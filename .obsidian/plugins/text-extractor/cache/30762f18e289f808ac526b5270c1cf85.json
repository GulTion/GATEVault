Suppose integers are hashed into these buckets using hash function h(x) = x mod 4. If the sequence of perfect squares 1, 4, 9, .., i2, ... is hashed into the table, then as the total number of entries in the table grows. What will happen? (@) All buckets will receive approximately the same number of entries. (b) All entries will go into one particular bucket. (c) Three of the buckets will each get approximately one-third of the entries, and the fourth bucket will remain empty. (d) Two of the buckets will get approximately half-half entries, and the other two will remain empty.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
