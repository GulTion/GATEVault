Although chaining is very popular and is faster, one disadvantage of chaining is its space requirement: when collision occurs, extra memory has to be allocated for the chain even when the hash table is not full, whereas in open addressing all the keys are stored in the hash table as long as the hash table is not full. Suppose that you store n records in a hash table of size m by chaining, where m > n, and suppose that you have a good hash function so that the probability that a key is hashed into any of the m slots is 1/m. For a particular slot in the hash table, what is the probability that this slot is empty, that is, none of the n keys hashes into this slot?
