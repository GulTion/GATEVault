For these two conditions to be true simultaneously, the necessary condition (may or may not be sufficient) is : [Choose the most appropriate one] (a) One function should be polynomial and other should be oscillatory. (b) Both functions should be exponential. (c) At least one function should be oscillatory. (d) One function should be exponential and other should be of higher order polynomial degree.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
