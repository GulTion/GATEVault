Delay for generating C'is 1 EXOR +1 AND +1 OR =24+12+12=48pus Delay for sum is XOR + XOR = 2.4 + 2.4 = 4.8 s But for the second adder, there the first EXOR can be done even before waiting for the previous output. So, we can get the sum in Another 2.4 s and carry in another 2.4 . In this way, 4-bit sum can be obtained after 4.8 us+3 % 2.4 ps =12 ps. But the question says we use ripple-carry adder. So, each adder must wait for the full output from the previous adder. This would make the total delay = 4 % 4.8 = 19.2 s and this is the key given by GATE, so obviously they meant this.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
