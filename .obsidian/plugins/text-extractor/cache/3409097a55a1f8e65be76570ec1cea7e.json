So we need 219 /2° = 210 page tables in 3rd level. This implies there are 210 entries in 2nd level and there are 29 entries per page table in 2nd level. Sowe need 21%/29 = 2 page tables in 2nd level. Now we have 2 entries in 1st level and hence,we need only 1 page table in 1st level. So on total we need, 210 4 2 4 1 = 1027 page tables each with 29 entries of size 8 bytes. Total size of page tables = 1027 * 27 * § Bytes = 1027 % 2'2 Bytes = 1027 x 4KB = 4108 KB.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
