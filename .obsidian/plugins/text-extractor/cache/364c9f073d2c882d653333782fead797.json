These stages take 5, 4, 20, 10 and 3 nanoseconds (ns) respectively. A pipelined implementation of the processor requires buffering between each pair of consecutive stages with a delay of 2 ns. Twq pipelined implementation of the processor are contemplated: . i. anaive pipeline implementation (NP) with 5 stages and ii. an efficient pipeline (EP) where the OF stage is divided into stages OF1 and OF2 with execution times of 12 nsand 8 ns respectively. The speedup (correct to two decimal places) achieved by EP over NP in executing 20 independent instructions with no hazards is : y","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
