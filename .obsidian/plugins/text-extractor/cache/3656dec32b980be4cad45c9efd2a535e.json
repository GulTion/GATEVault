For a given program P that has 30% branch instructions, control hazards incur 2 cycles stall for every branch. A new version of the processor X, operating at same clock frequency has an additional branch predictor unit (BPU) that completely eliminates stalls for correctly predicted branches. There is neither any savings nor any additional stalls for wrong predictions. There are no structural hazards and data hazards for X; and X. If the BPU has a prediction accuracy of 80%, the speed up (rounded off to two decimal places) obtained by X5 over X; in executing P is e 0.72 J 1.42 0 0.64 @ 1.64 GATE CSE 2022 Computer Organization","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
