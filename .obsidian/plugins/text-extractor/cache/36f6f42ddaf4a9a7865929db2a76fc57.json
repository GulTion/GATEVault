(a) Threads can share the Code segments. They have only separate Registers and stack. So (a) is False (b) User level threads are scheduled by the thread library and kernel knows nothing about it. So, (b) is False. (c) Context switching between user level threads is faster as they actually have no context-switch- nothing is saved and restored while for kernel level thread, Registers, PC and SP must be saved and restored. So, (c) also False.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
