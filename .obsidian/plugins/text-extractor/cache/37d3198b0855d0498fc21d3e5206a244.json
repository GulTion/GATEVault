External fragmentation occurs when different sized blocks are allocated from alarger chunk of ‘memory, leading o a challenge of finding new blocks after the system runs for a while.Page-based memory allocation avoids this problem because all pages are the same size. (b) False. If the OS can fixup the faul, then it can restart the process. A good example of thisis a page-fault, in which the OS can load the missing page from disk, fix the page table, and restartthe process. (c) False. Belady’s anomaly states that adding more memory can increase page faults forcertain page replacement algorithms (e.g., FIFO). (d) False. Working set is the subset of the address space the process is currently working through.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
