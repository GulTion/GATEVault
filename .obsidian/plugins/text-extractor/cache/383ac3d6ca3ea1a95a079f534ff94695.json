The instruction mix is such that 15% of instructions cause one bubble to be inserted into the pipeline, and 10% of instructions cause two bubbles to be inserted. The equivalent single-cycle implementation would lead to a clock rate of 150 MHz. What is the percentage increase in the pipeline CPI over the ideal CP as a result of bubbles?","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
