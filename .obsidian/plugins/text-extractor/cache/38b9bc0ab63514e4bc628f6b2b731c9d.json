We have declared a variable Â¢ of union type. Union declared only single space of the maximum size of variable. Here a.c.a.= 25 It means in the union space we have assigned 25. We are accessing the a.c.b which is also the same location where 25 has stored. So the output will be 25 without any error.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
