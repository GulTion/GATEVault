The content of each of the memory locations from 2000 to 2010 is 100. The program is loaded from the memory location 1000. All the numbers are in decimal. Assume that the memory is byte addressable and the word size is 32 bits. If an interrupt occurs during the execution of the instruction \"INC R3\", what return address will be pushed on to the stack?","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
