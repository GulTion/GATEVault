No need to waste time in finding binary. Only focus on 1st 3 bits of binary. (From left side, 1st bit is 128,next one is 64,next one is 32..it goes like that you know.) 97: 0+ 64 + 32+ something so 1st 3 bits will contain 011 80: 0 + 64 + 0+ something so 010 135: 128 + 0 + 0+ something so 100 110: 0 + 64 + 32+ something so 011 67: 0+ 64 + 0+ something so 010 155: 128 + 0 + 04 something so 100 So we got 011, 010, 100 3 subnets.... subnet id are... 192.168.1.96 192.168.1.64 192.168.1.128","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
