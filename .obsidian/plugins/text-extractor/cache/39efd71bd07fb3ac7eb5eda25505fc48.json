Sample Space: { BBB, BBG, BGG, GGG} Number of possibilities with At most one boy is = 2. P(F)=2/4=1/2. Number of possibilities where both the sex are possible= 2 So,P(E)=24=1/2. Now, P(E N F) = 1/4 as the only possibility is â€œBGG\" P(ENF)=1/4= P(E) N P(F), Which is the definition of Independent Events. So both the events are independent.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
