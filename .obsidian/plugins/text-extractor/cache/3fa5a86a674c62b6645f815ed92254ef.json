Where as it is \"er not always divisible by 3.(You don't always get an integer..truncation possible, less accuracy) (C) eliminated. In option (B) n * (n — 1)/2 gives an integer value. This integer value multiplied by (n — 2) again gives an integer value. Which when divided by 3 gives an integer value(Sets p correctly). Reason:n * (n — 1) % (n — 2) is the multiplication of 3 consecutive numbers. which is divisible by 2 as well as 3. Hence, (n * (n — 1)/2 % (n — 2)) is divisible by 3.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
