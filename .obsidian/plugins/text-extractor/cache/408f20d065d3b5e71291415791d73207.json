IP layer of B now removes 20 bytes of I P header and has 200 bytes of data. So, it makes 3 IP packets - [80 + 20, 80 + 20,40 + 20] and sends to C as the Ip packet size of B is 100. So, C receives 260 bytes of data which includes 60 bytes of I.P headers and 20 bytes of TCP header. For data rate, we need to consider only the slowest part of the network as data will be getting accumulated at that sender (data rate till that slowest part, we need to add time if a faster part follows a slower part). So, here 180 bytes of application data are transferred from A to C and this causes 260 bytes to be transferred from Bto C. Correct Answer: D E","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
