The disk is operated in cycle stealing mode whereby whenever a 60 bits word is ready it is sent to memory; similarly, for writing, the disk interface reads a 60 bits word from the memory in each DMA cycle. Memory cycle time is 100 nanoseconds. The maximum percentage of time that the CPU gets blocked during DMA operation is (Rounded off up to two decimal places)","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
