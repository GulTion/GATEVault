(a) 62, 63 and 64 (b) 64 and 65 (c) 64 only (d) 64, 65 and 66 Answer: None Since first outstanding frame sf is 62 and still it is in window that means its ACK has not arrived same for 63, and receiver is expecting 64 that means 64 is not received by receiver but it has sent the ACK for 62 and 63 as Rn is 64, so according to me no options are matched. 62 and 63 are the ACK that are in transit.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
