It gathers link state information from available routers and constructs a topology map of the network. It computes the shortest-path-tree for each route using a method based on Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm. Ref-1. OSPF is hierarchical routing protocol, using area 0 (Autonomous System) at the top of the hierarchy.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
