Assume that the file system uses a multilevel i-node data structure to track data blocks of a file. The i-node has 64 bytes of space available to store pointers to data blocks, including a single indirect block, a double indirect block, and several direct blocks. What is the maximum file size (in KB) that can be stored in such a file system?","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
