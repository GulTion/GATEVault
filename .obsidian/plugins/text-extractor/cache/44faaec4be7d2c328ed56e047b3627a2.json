So, it is false. (b) It is function because for each NFA we have only one minimized DFA. So, it is true. (c) It is function because for each DFA we have only one language. But It is not one-one because multiple DFA accepts same language. Similarly, it not onto because there are some languages for which DFA cannot be exists. So, it is true. (d) It is not function because for each regular language there exists multiple DFA’s. So, it is false.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
