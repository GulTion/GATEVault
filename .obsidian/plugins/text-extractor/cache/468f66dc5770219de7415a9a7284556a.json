A file of size 100 blocks is already stored in A and also in B. Now, consider inserting a new block in the middle of the file (between 50\" and 51Â° block), whose data is already available in the memory. Assume that there are enough free blocks at the end of the file and that the file control blocks are already in memory. Let the number of disk accesses required to insert a block in the middle of the file in A and B are ny and np, respectively, then the value of ng + np is","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
