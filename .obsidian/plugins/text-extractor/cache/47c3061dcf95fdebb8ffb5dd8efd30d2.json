Consider a faster computer A running insertion sort against a slower computer B running merge sort; Both must sort an array of one million (n=10) numbers. Suppose computer A executes 10 billion (1019) instruction per second. Computer B executes hundred million (109) instruction per second. So computer A is 100 times faster than computer B. Which computer will run the corresponding sorting program faster and by how much faster? (a) Computer A will run faster by 50 times (b) Computer B will run faster by 50 times (Â¢) Computer A will run faster by 100 times (d) Computer B will run faster by 100 times","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
