So,i=a=Oandj=a+b=0+1=1 Now,i=i+1=0+1=1. So,i=a=1// Due to call by reference. So, “print (a + i, j)” will print 2 (As,a +i=1+1=2) and 1 (asj = 1). After that again we return in main (). Then “print a” will print 1 (s, a= 1). So, output will be: 2 1 1. In call by name: In main(: a=0,b=1 Now foo (a, a + b) is called by name. So, the variable i is replace by a and j is replace by a + b. a=atl=0+1=1 //Asi=i+1 So, “print (a + i, j);” means will , “print (a + a, a + b);” So,itwill print: 2,2 //a+ta=1+1=2anda+b=1+1=2. In main(): “Print a;°/ / It will print 1 because a = 1. So, the overall output is: 2 2 1","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
