Even time slots (i.e., 0, 2, 4, ...) are reserved for the 4-user group. Odd time slots (i, 1,3,5, ..) are reserved for the 26-user group. Contention within each group is resolved by the slotted ALOHA protocol (e.g., when a user in the 26-user group wants to send, it waits for an odd slot and then transmits with a probability p).The optimal p is 1/N, where N is the total number of node in particular group. Assume that every user always has something to send and in each group the users use the optimal probability Q11. | What is the probability of successful transmission in even slot?
