A directed graph G with n vertices is represented by its adjacency matrix A, where A[i][j] = 1if there is an edge directed from vertex i to j and 0 otherwise. The following algorithm determines whether there is a sink in the graph G. i=o0; do { j=i+1; while ((j < n) && E1) j++; if (j < n) E2; } while (j < n); flag = 1; for (j = 0; j <n; j++) if ((§! = i) && E3) flag = 0; if (flag) printf(\"sink exists\") ; else printf (\"Sink does not exist\"); Choose the correct expression for E3 A.
