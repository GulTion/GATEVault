Therefore Waiting time of P4 should be 0. And total waiting time of P3 = 14- ( Burst time of P4) because until P4 completes P3 does not get a chance.

Therefore, Waiting time of P3 remains the same. And total waiting time of P4 = ( Burst time of P3) because until P3 completes P4 does not get a chance. Then average waiting time = w =1 % # 1 = This case is invalid. Correct Answer: 2","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
