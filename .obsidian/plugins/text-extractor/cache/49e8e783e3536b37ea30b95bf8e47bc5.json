In deadlock, a process can’t respond to another process’s changes/method calls because it’s blocked. Note: This is the livelock definition. (b) True. In deadlock, a process can’t respond to another process’s changes/method calls because it’s blocked. Note: This is the deadlock definition. (c) True. Banker’s Algorithm determines a safe state by finding AN ORDERING of processes. There are other orderings possible that can bring the system to a safe state. (d) False. Resources can be ordered in some absolute fashion (i.e., alphabetical ordering) and can be acquired by processes in that order — without use of the Banker’s algorithm.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
