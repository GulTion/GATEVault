So, when loop terminates either ¢ = n.or j = m. ) Suppose % = n. This would mean all elements from array a are added to ¢ => k must be incremented by n. ¢ would also contain j elements from array b. So, number of ? elements in ¢ would be 7 + j and hence k = n + j. t . . :e, Similarly, when j = m, k = m + 4. Hence, option (D) is correct. (Had k started from —1 and not 0 and we used + + k& inside loop, answer would have been option (C))","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
