Q/ 1. Switching to ready processes after termination of currently executing process also a context switch. frovy 2. There is no context switch from S to P. ( Therefore P should be complete with in 1 TQ ) R 3. There are exactly two context switches from Q to R ( Therefore Q and R both should requires more than 1 TQ ) 4. There is exactly one context switch from R to Q ( Therefore Q require more time than R ) 5. Exactly one context swich from R to S. ( Therefore S should be complete with in 1 TQ otherwise another CS from R to S required.) 6. Exactly one conext switch from Sto Q Accumulating all the above points QUEUE - PQ,RS.QRQ Given that time quantum = 4. 0<Ppr<4 0<Spr<4 8 < Q@sr 4<Rpr<8 in Option D, Q's BT=7.
