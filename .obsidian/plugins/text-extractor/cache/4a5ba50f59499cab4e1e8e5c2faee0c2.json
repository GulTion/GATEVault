Not an equivalence relation (b) (2a+5b) mob 7 =0 For relation to be reflexive aRa (2a+5a) mod7 =0 true For symmetric if (aRb) then (bRa ) If (2a+5b) mod 7 =0 Then (2b+5a) mod7=0 is always there So it is symmetric. ex: (1,8) (2*1+5*8)mod7=0 (8,1) (2*8+5*1)mod7=0 Itis transitive also as (1, ), (8, 1) €R then (1, 1) and (8, 8) also belongs to R (Reflexive) So (b) is equivalence relation.
