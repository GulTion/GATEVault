Which of the following statements is/are TRUE about B+-tree? (a) The maximum fan-out of a B+-tree is equal to 2d. (b) When an insertion into a B+ tree causes a root node to split, the height of the tree always increases. (c) As the number of keys in a B+ tree of order d increases, 10 cost for searches grows logarithmically with the number of keys. (d) Clustered and unclustered B+ trees provide the same performance benefits for all queries.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
