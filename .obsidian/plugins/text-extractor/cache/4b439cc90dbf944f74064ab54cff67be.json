[n<m] e m! n_m 0 m\" O m! Your answer is Correct (m—mn)! m\" Solution : (¢) Total outcomes when inserting n keys in m slots: m choices m M om————— Each key can go to any of the m slots, so Total outcomes = m X m X m X ........ n times = m\" Favourable outcomes is when no collision happens m(m-1) (m—=2) ..... (m—n+1) % key So favourable outcomes = m(m - 1) ....... (m -n + 1) m(m—1)(m-2) .......(m—-n+1) Probability = —————————— m m(m—1) ....... (m—-n+1)(m-n)! m!
