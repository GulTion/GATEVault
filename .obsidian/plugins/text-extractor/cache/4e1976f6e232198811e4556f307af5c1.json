The propagation delay per kilometer is t seconds. Let R bits/second be the channel capacity. Assuming that processing delay is negligible, the minimum number of bits for the sequence number field in a frame for maximum utilization, when the selective repeat protocol is used, is: 2LtR 2LtR (a) [log, 225) + 1 (b) [log, (1 + 25N +1 2LtR 2LtR () llog, (1 +25)) (d) Llog, (1 +25)) +1","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
