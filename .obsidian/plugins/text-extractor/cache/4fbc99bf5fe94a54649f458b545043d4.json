The path from node A to node D passes through 3 links, and 2 intermediate nodes. Each of the links is a 10km optical fiber with a rate of 10 Mbps. The 2 intermediate nodes ar_and each intermediate node must perform a 25 psec routing table look up after receiving first 200 bits of a packet before it can begin sending it on the outgoing link.
