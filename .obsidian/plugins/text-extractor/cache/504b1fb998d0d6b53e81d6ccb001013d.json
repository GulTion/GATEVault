The new graph won't have any edges and so 2 SCC. (B) is true. In a directed graph an SCC will have a path from each vertex to every other vertex. So, changing the direction of all the edges, won't change the SCC. (D) is false. Consider any graph with isolated vertices- we loose those components. r (C) is a bit tricky. Any edge is a path of length 1. So, the new graph will have all the edges from old one. Also, we are adding new edges (u, 11). So, does this modify any SCC? No, because we add an edge (u,v), only if there is already a path of length < 2 from u to v- so we do not create a new path. So, both (B) and (C) must answer, though GATE key says only B.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
