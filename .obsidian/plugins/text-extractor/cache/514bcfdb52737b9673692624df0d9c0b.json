Now we are allowed to connect only those points which are atmost 1 distance apart (in both horizontal and vertical direction). So we will connect only horizontal neighbours, vertical neighbours, and diagonal neighbours. - So horizontal edges on each row are 11 i.e. 11 x 12 = 132 horizontal edges. Similarly we have 132 vertical edges. To count diagonal edges, think of 1 x 1 square boxes in which diagonals meet each other. There are 11 x 11 such square boxes, and each box contains 2 diagonals, so total diagonals = 242. So total edges = 132 + 132 + 242 = 506.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
