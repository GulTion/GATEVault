We have defined certain variable for the proper working of Go- Back-N protocol: Sy=Sender window side, Rw=Receiver window side, S=Send window first (oldest) outstanding frame, S,= Send window next frame to send, Rn=Receiver window next frame expected and m= #bits for sequence number. In a network using the Go-Back-N protocol with m = 3 and the sending window of size 7, the values of variables are 5= 62, 5,= 66, and R,= 64.Assume that the network does not duplicate or reorder the packets. Q31. | What are the sequence numbers of data packets in transit? (a) 62, 63 and 64 (b) 64 and 65 (c) 64 only (d) 64, 65 and 66 Answer: B As Rn is 64 means expected frame is 64 and sf is 62 it means 62,63 already received by receiver as sn is 66 means 64,65 are in transit.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
