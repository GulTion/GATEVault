If no token is available for an arriving packet, it is discarded. Suppose that at time 0, the token bucket is empty and the next token “arrives” at time 10 milliseconds. If packets arrive at times 11, 13, 17, 19, 23 and 29, How many tokens are in the token bucket at time 55 milliseconds if no additional packets arrive?","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
