Place each integer selected into the pigeonhole corresponding to the set that contains it. Since 11 integers are selected and placed into 10 pigeonholes, some pigeonhole contains two pigeons. By the way the pigeonholes were defined, these two integers differ by two. So, required answer is 11.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
