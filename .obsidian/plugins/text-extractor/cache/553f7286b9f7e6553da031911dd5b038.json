It must be a trap instruction - Definitely it must be a trap instruction as RFE is an explicit privileged instruction causing a switch from kernel to user mode 2. It must be a privileged instruction - Yes, because RFE can be executed only in supervisor/kernel mode 3. An exception cannot be allowed to occur during execution of an RFE instruction - Yes, because as soon as a trap/interrupt starts being processed all other traps/interrupts are disabled until the current instruction execution is complete.
