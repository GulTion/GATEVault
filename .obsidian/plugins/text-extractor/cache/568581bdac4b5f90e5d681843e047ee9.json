Assuming that each frame carries 10KB of data and the size of the acknowledgement frame is negligible, then to achieve a link utilization of 100%, what is the minimum number of bits you need for the sequence number field? (You can assume 1KB = 10° bytes, and 1GB = 10° bytes)","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
