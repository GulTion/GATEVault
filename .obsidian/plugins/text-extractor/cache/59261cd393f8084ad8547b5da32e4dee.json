Suppose we define a cycle graph as a connected undirected graph in which every vertex has degree two. Then the vertices in a cycle can be colored using two colors so that no two adjacent vertices are assigned the same color. 2. Suppose every edge in an undirected graph has a unique weight. Then there must be a minimum-cost spanning tree that includes the edge with minimum weight. 3. Suppose every edge in an undirected graph has a unique weight. Then there must be a minimum-cost spanning tree that does not include the edge with maximum weight. . A tree is a bipartite graph. . Every graph contains a Hamiltonian cycle.
