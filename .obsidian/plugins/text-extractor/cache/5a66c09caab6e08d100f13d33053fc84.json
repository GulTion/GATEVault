These distances (a)are the shortest possible distances to every destination node. (b) are never the shortest possible distances when negative edge weights are present. (c) may be the shortest possible distances when negative edge weights are present. (dymay not always be the shortest possible distances when all edge weights are positive.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
