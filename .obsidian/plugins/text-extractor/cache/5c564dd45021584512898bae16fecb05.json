The input device transmits data at a rate of 9600 bytes per second. The CPU is fetching and executing instructions at an average rate of 1,000,000 instructions per second. Assume that size of each instruction is4bytes. The CPU will be slowed down because of the DMA transfer by percent. Answer : (0.24) Solution : In 1 second, the input device transfers 9600 bytes of data. This is equivalent to 9600 / 4 = 2400 DMA cycles, as 4 bytes are transferred every cycle. Earlier, in 1 second, 1,000,000 instructions were executed. But now, in 1 second, (1,000,000 â€” 2400) = 997600 instructions are executed. So, slowdown = 2400/1000000 = 0.24 %","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
