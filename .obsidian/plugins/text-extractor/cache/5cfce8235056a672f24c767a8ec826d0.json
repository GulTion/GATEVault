Note that whenever we split a leaf node, we move one key to the internal nodes. So, we have L — 1 keys in internal nodes if we have L leaf nodes. If only 2 leaf nodes, So, no. of keys in root node = 1 or L — 1. Once there is an overflow in a single leaf node then no of leaf nodes now would become 3 and at the same the time we will have one more key in our root node.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
