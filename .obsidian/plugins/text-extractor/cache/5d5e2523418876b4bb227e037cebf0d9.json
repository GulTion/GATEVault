The device with the highest priority is placed in the first position, followed by lower-priority devices up to the device with the lowest priority, which is placed last in the chain. . s false « Vectored interrupts are achieved by assigning each interrupting device a unique code, typically four to eight bits in length. When a device interrupts, it sends its unique code over the data bus to the processor, telling the processor which interrupt service routine to execute. 11l is true « The process of periodically checking status bits to see if it is time for the next I/0 operation, is called polling. Polling is the simplest way for an I/0 device to communicate with the processor the processor. IV.is false « Since CPU release bus only after getting request from DMA and get after DMA release the BUS.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
