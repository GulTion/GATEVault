The first machine resolves branches in the EX-stage using a predict-not-taken scheme. The second machine resolves branches in the ID stage using one branch delay slot. Assume that « They all run at the same frequency « 20% of the instructions are branches o 75% of branches are not taken and « Stalls are due to branches alone. What minimum percentage of delay slots should be filled with useful instructions for the second machine so that the second machine runs equal as or faster than the first machine?
