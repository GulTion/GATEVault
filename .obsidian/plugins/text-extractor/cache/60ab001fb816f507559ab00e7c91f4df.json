The functionality of the five stages of this pipeline is as follows : 1. IF - Instruction fetch from instruction memory 2. RD - Instruction decode and Register read 3. EX - Execute-ALU cooperation for data & address calculation 4. MA - Data memory access 5. WB - Register write back Consider the following instructions in which the destination register is the first (leftmost) register. Branch is resolved in the RD stage and there is an independent instruction in the delay slot. sub ri,r2,r3; or r3,r2,ri; loadword r4, 32(r3); add r3,r4,r1; beq r5,r6, target; Assume that there is No operand forwarding and the compiler inserts NOP instructions to eliminate hazards, no other optimization is performed. Which of the following is correct? A. Number of RAW dependencies in the code : 4 B. Number of WAW dependencies in the code : 2 C. Number of WAR dependencies in the code : 2 D. 6 NOP instructions are inserted to eliminate the hazards.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
