(a) Given two heaps with n elements each, it is possible to construct a single heap comprising all 2n elements in O(n) time. (b) Building a heap with n elements can always be done in O(nlogn) time. (c) In a heap of depth d, there must be at least 29 elements. (Assume the depth of the first element (or root) is zero). (d) We can always find the maximum in a min-heap in O(log n) time Answer: a, b, ¢ Solution: BASIC DATA STRUCTURE AND ALGORITHMPage 42 e (&) We can build a heap of 2n elements in O(n) time. Following are the steps. Create an array of size 2n and copy elements of both heaps to this array. Call build heap for the array of size 2n. Build heap operation takes O (n) time. (b) True, (refer ma’am’s notes) (c) True (d) FALSE. The maximum element in a min-heap can be anywhere in the bottom level of the heap. There are up to n/2 elements in the bottom level, so finding the maximum can take up to O (n) time.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
