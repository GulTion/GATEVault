Leaf nodes will have a record pointer for each key value (because the file is not ordered on that field) plus one block pointer to the next leaf node, sopiesr= [(B-P) / (V+PR)| = [512B - 6 B) / (9B+7B)| = 31. There will be [0.69xpie] = [0.69x31] = 21 search keys per leaf node. Since the file is not ordered on that field, there will have to be a search record for each record in the file, or 30,000 of them. So, the number of leaf blocks is [30,000/21] = 1429 blocks. (The ceiling because the last block will be partially full )","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
