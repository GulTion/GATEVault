For example SRTF gives best minimize turnaround time among all. So option (a) and (Â¢ is true. Option (b) is false because it may create convey effect in system which result in higher average turnaround just like in FCFS. Option (d) is false because if the current running process has large CPU burst time, in that case preference to that process result in lower average turnaround time.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
