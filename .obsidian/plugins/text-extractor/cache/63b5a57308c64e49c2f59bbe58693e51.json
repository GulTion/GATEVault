So in 20 milliseconds processor execute total 40000000 cycles. And the number of times polling operation is perform in this 40000000 cycles is 40000000/500 = 80000 times and each time processor spend 100 cycles to perform polling. Therefore, number of cycle total spend on polling operation = 80000 x 100 = 8000000 cycles. Also given that the code to process 2 bytes of data and store it in a memory takes 2000 cycles, therefore total number cycle to process 2000 bytes of data = 1000 x 2000 = 2000000 cycles. Therefore, total cycles does the entire operation take is 8000000 + 2000000 = 10000000 cycles","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
