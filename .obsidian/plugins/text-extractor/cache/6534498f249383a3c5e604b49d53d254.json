We need one bit per set to identify which of these blocks is the LRU block. Note that if block 0 is the LRU block, then block 1 is the MRU (most recently used) block, and vice versa. If the cache was 4- way set associative, each set needs to record the LRU block, the second-LRU block, .., the MRU block. There are 4! = 24 permutations of 4 blocks, and hence the cache needs L = llog,(41] = 5 LRU bits per set.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
