Since the languages recognized by NDTMs are exactly the r.e. sets, this suffices. Alternatively, this language can be enumerated by trying all TMs on all possible inputs for all possible number of steps and dovetailing. S2 true : This holds by Rice's theorem, since the class of nonempty re. sets is a nonempty proper subset of the class of all r.e. sets.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
