Each stage except PO takes 1 clock cycle each for any instruction. The PO stage takes 2 clock cycles for ADD and SUB instructions, 5 clock cycles for MUL instruction, and 6 clock cycles for DIV instruction respectively. Assume that operands are only forwarded from WB to OF stage and register file can be written in the first half of the cycle and read in the second half. Instruction Meaning of instruction 10: MUL R2, RO, R1 R2 — RO *R1 11: DIV RS, R3, R4 RS — R3/R4 12: ADD R2, RS, R2 R2 — R5+R2 13: SUB RS, R2, R6 RS — R2-R6 What is the number of clock cycles needed to execute the following sequence of instructions?","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
