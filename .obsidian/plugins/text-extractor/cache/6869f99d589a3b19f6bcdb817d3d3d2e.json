What is the minimum base of the numbers? Answer: 5 Solution Use same concept of quadratic equation when you solve. It will be independent of base now if ask for minimum base so answer will be 5 because (it can be greater than equal to 5) the highest no is 4 in equation \"142x\". Let ax? + bx* + cx + d = O be any cubic equation and a,p.y are roots. Formula: a+p+y=-bla ap+pPpy+ya=c/a apy=-da Solution: a=1,$=10,y=12 Sum of root = -b/a","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
