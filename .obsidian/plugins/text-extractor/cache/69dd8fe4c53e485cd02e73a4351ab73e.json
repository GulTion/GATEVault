(c) TRUE: Multiple packet losses from a window of data can have a catastrophic effect on TCP throughput. TCP uses a cumulative acknowledgment scheme in which received segments that are not at the left edge of the receive window are not acknowledged. This forces the sender to either wait a roundtrip time to find out about each lost packet, or to unnecessarily retransmit segments which have been correctly received. With the cumulative acknowledgment scheme, multiple dropped segments generally cause TCP to lose its ACK-based clock, reducing overall throughput. Selective Acknowledgment (SACK) is a strategy which corrects this behavior in the face of multiple dropped segments. With selective acknowledgments, the data receiver can inform the sender about all segments that have arrived successfully, so the sender need retransmit only the segments that have actually been lost. \\wque;z\\ /Segx// @ xe—\" ><5!53/ ® ><A§; :>'< ® Ak, ssck3, \\:\\m Sacksa\\’ ® © \\A:kd\\","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
