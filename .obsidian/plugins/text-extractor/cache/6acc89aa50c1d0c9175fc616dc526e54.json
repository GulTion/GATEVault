Find the cardinality of equivalence relation. Solution : 109 For finding the equivalence relation from a partition of set each block of partition is multiplied to itself. Example: m, = {{1, 2} {3}} Then equivalence relation = {{1, 2} x {1, 2}, {3} x {3}} ={1L1@12(21)(@2263) Thus, Cardinality = 2x2+1=5 Similarly, for the given question 3x (5 +4(27 +2x (3 = 3x25+4x4+18 = 75+16+18 =109","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
