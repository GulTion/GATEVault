(a) 2421 code (b) 3132 code (c) 5211 code (d) 4421 code Answer :-D Solution A self -complementing code have a property that its weights adds up to g. 2+4+2+1 =9 3+1+3+2=9 5+2+1+1=9 4+4+ 2+1=11 and 11 # 9 therefore it is not self complementing code. Q62.| Which of the following is/are self-complementary code? (a) 2421 (b) Excess-3 (c) 5211 (d)84-21 Answer :(a),(b)&(c) Solution : Excess - 3 - code is also known as self-complementing code which means 1's complement of an excess - 3 number is the excess - 3 code for the 9's complement of the corresponding decimal number. 1 in binary is 0001 excess 3 code is 0001 + 0011 = 0100 1's complement of the above code is 1011 which is 11 11 is excess 3 code for 8 and 9's complement of 1is 8","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
