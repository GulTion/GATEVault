During this time all 20 frames of windows has transmitted. So as soon first ACK of 1st window arrived we start transmitting 1t frame of second window now the ACK of first frame of second window arrived at 2 x (t,+ tp + txa + tp) = 42.048, during this time all the ACK of 1st window frames and data frames of second has been transmitted. This process continues up to 4window. The ACK of first packet of 4t'window arrived at 4 x (t,+ tp + txa + tp) = 84.096. Now as soon 1st ACK of 4thwindow arrive, we start transmitting 1stframe of 5% window. Now for the last window, the final ACK of Last frame come when the Last frame has transmitted. The last frame transmitted after 19 frames has been transmitted. So, once we transmit 20t frame of last window, then we are only waiting for the last frame. this will be 20 tx + tp + txa + tp for the last window. So overall total time = 4 x (t,+ tp + txa + tp) + 20 tx + tp + txa + tp =4x(t,+txa+RTT) + 20 tx + txa + RTT 84.096 +40.48 ms = 124.576ms Throughput for this =% = %: 821.988 Kbps","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
