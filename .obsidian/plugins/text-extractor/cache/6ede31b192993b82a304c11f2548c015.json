Number of data block pointers in the inode = 64/4 = 16, of which 14 are direct blocks. The single indirect block stores pointers to 512/4 = 128 data blocks. The double indirect block points to 128 single indirect blocks, which in turn point to 128 data blocks each. So, the total number of data blocks in a file can be 14 + 128 + 128*128 = 16526, and the maximum file size is 16526512 bytes or (16526*512)/1024 = 8263 Kbytes","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
