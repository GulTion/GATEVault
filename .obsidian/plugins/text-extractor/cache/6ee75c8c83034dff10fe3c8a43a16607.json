The merge sort algorithm presented in class always divides and merges the array O(log n) times, so the running time is always O(n log n). Option C FALSE. The maximum element in a min-heap can be anywhere in the bottom level of the heap. There are up to n/2 elements in the bottom level, so finding the maximum can take up to O(n) time. Option D true The minimum number of elements in a heap of depth d is one more than the maximum number of elements in a heap of depth (d - 1). Since a level at depth d in a binary }dnelap can have up to 29 elements, the number of elements at depth (d - 1) Moo=t =0 is So the minimum number of elements in a heap of depth d is 4-1)+1=29.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
