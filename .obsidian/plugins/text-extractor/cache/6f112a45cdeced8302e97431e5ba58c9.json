The size of each index entry is R= (9 + 6) = 15 bytes, so the blocking factor for the index is bfri= L®BR)) = [(1024/15)] = 68 entries per block. The total number of index entries ris equal to the number of blocks in the data file, which is 3000. The number of index blocks is hence b= ity = [ 3000/68)] = 45 blocks. To perform a binary search on the index file would need [(logzb‘)] = [ﬂogz45)] = 6 block accesses. To search for a record using the index, we need one additional block access to the data file for a total of 6 + 1 = 7 block accesses—an improvement over binary searchon the data file, which required 12 disk block accesses. 12-7=5","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
