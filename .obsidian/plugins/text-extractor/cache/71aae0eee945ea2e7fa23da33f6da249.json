Assume that it chooses to send segments of 1460 bytes of data each, back-to-back without any delay. Also assume that there is no error in the channel, and there is no retransmission of segment. Taking into account that the size of the TCP and IP header is 20 bytes and 20 bytes respectively, and ignoring any other overhead, how long (in sec) would it take for the TCP sequence space to wrap around completely?
