() Let D is the set of DFA and R is the set of regular expressions over {a, b}, then F is a function from D to R that maps a DFA to corresponding regular expressions. (b) Let D is the set of minimized DFA and N is the set of NFA over {a, b}, then F is a function from N to D that maps a NFA to corresponding DFA. (c) Let D is the set of DFA and L is the set of language over {a, b}, then F is only function (its neither injective function nor surjective function) from D to L that maps a DFA to corresponding language. (d) Let D is the set of DFA and R is the set of regular language over {a, b}, then F is a function from R to D that maps a regular language to corresponding DFA.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
