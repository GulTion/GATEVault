Then, which of the following are approaches its scheduler could take to help achieve this goal? (@) prefer to run processes that would start their next 1/O operations sooner (b) prefer to run more CPU-intensive processes before other processes (o) prefer to run more processes that have been runnable less often than other processes (d)When an 1/O operation finishes, wait to schedule the newly runnable process until the currently running process is ready to yield the CPU.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
