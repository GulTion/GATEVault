Host H 4 in network A sends messages each containing 180 bytes of application data to a host H¢ in network C. The TCP layer prefixes 20 byte header to the message. This passes through an intermediate network B.The maximum packet size, including 20 byte IP header, in each network is: « A:1000 bytes « B:100 bytes « C:1000 bytes The network A and B are connected through a 1 Mbps link, while B and C are connected by a 512 Kbps link (bps = bits per second). 1 Mbps 512 Kbps Network A Network B Network C Assuming that the packets are correctly delivered, how many bytes, including headers, are delivered to the IP layer at the destination for one application message, in the best case?
