For any two random variables X, Y on the same probability space, if E(X) > E(Y’) then PriX>Y]>0 True. [Proof by contradiction: if Pr[X > ¥] = 0 then we always have X <Y, so clearly E(X) < E(Y) ] C. Let A and B be events in the same sample space. If p(A | B) = 1/2,thenp (A | B°) = 1/2. False. If A C B,thenp (A | B°) = 0. D. For every random variable X, E (X2) > E(X)?. Answer: TRUE.
