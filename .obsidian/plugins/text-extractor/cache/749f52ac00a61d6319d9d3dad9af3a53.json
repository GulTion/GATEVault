Process A arrives at t = 0, and runs on the CPU for 10 time units before it finishes. Process B arrives at t = 6, and requires an initial CPU time of 3 units, after which it blocks to perform 1/0 for 3 time units. After returning from 1/0 wait, it executes for a further 5 units before terminating. Process C arrives at t = 8, and runs for 2 units of time on the CPU before terminating. For the Shortest Remaining Time First (preemptive) scheduling policy, the time of completion of process B is. .","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
