Socase 0 »i=5 case 1l »i=5+2=7 case 5 »>i=7+5=12 default »=12+4 =16 i will be incremented by 1 & become 17 because of the for loop the condition is true as (17 < 20) So again the default case will run Default »i=17 + 4 =21 Again i will be incremented by 1 —i=21 + 1 = 22 & then the condition will be false (22 < 20) So answer is 22.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
