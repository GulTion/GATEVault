Three semaphores empty, full and mutez are defined with respective initial values of 0, NV and 1. Semaphore emypty denotes the number of available slots in the buffer, for the consumer to read from. Semaphore full denotes the number of available slots in the buffer, for the producer to write to. The placeholder variables, denoted by P, @, R and S, in the code below can be assigned either empty or full. The valid semaphore operations are: wait() and sigmal(). Producer: Consumer: do { do { wait (P); wait (R); wait (mutex); wait (mutex); //Add item to buffer //consume item from buffer signal (mutex); signal (mutex); signal (Q); signal (S); Jwhile (1); Ywhile (1); Which one of the following assignments tp P, @, R and .S will yield the correct solution?
