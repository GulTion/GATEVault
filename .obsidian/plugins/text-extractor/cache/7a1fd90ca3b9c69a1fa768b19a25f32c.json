Sequence numbers start at 0, increment by 1, and roll over to O after the minimum distinct number required guarantesing error-free operation of SRP. At a certain instant of time, the receiver transmits a cumulative ACK with sequence number 3. Assume that ACK sequence number represent next expected sequence number by receiver. Which of the following are sequence numbers of frames that can be in the receiver’s buffer at that instant? Frames and ACKs may be lost or delayed but not reordered.
