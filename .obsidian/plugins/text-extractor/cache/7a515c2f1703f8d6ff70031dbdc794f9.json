To determine the definitions that can reach a given point in a program requires assigning distinct number to each definition. To compute two sets for each basic block B: GEN [B]: Set of generated definitions within block B. Kill [B]: Set of definitions outside of B that define identifiers that also have definition within B. To compute the sets IN[B] and OUT[B]: IN [B]: Set of all definition reaching the point just before the first statement of block B. OUT [B]: Set of definitions reaching the point just after the last statement of B. ‘Which of the following Data Flow equations is/are correct?
