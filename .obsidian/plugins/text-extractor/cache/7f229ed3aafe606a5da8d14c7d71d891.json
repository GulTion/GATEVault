(b) Round Robin could have a minimum turnaround time if the time quantum is more than the burst time of all the process & process arrive in the increasing order of burst time. (c) SRTF has minimum average turnaround time. (d) In Preemptive priority-based scheduling if the priority is assigned in a way that the process with minimum burst time has the highest priority then it could have minimum average turnaround time.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
