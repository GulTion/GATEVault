From the relational instance given, we may strike out F'D s that do not hold. e.g. B does not functionally determine C' (This is true). But, we cannot say that A functionally determines B for the entire relation itself. This is because that, A — B holds for this instance, but in future there might be some tuples added to the instance that may violate A — B. So, overall on the relation we cannot conclude that A — B, from the relational instance which is just a subset of an entire relation.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
