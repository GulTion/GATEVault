Which of the following are true? (S1): Count to infinity is a problem only with DV and not LS routing (S2): In LS, the shortest path algorithm is run only at one node (S3): In DV, the shortest path algorithm is run only at one node (S4): DV requires lesser number of network messages than LS e S1,S2 and S4 only @ S1,S3 and S4 only e S2 and S3 only @ S1and S4 only","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
