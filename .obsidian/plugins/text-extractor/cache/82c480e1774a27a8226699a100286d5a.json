Now the 274 inner query will those committee name referred by outer query. Not exist (C1 - Ca) Not exist condition true so it will select piper, Next not exist (C1 - C2) so not exist condition false so it will not select any row. Similarly for Rose not exist (C: — C;) not exists condition true. It will print piper and rose. S2 Query: It is also a correlated query here the 1+ inner query will select commit name of piper ‘C1’ here. Now the 27 inner queries will select committee name whose A.profname not equal to B.profname so it select committee name of Cz and C; (with condition piper = Adam and piper = rose). So (C1 — (Cz, C1)) with exist condition false. So it will not select any professor name.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
