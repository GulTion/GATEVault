Correct Option Solution : @ 'UDP receiver can’t be absolutely sure that no bit errors have occurred. Because as per the checksum calculation mechanism, if the corresponding bits of two 16 bit words in the packet were 0 and 1, then even if these get flipped to 1 and 0 respectively, the sum still remains the same. Hence the 1’s complement, the receiver calculate is also same. Hence, checksum gets verified, even when there was actually an error during transmission. TCP also uses the same checksum mechanism. Hence the statement will hold true for TCP also.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
