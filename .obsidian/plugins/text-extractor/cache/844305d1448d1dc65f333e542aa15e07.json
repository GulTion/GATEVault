This means 3NV F' still allows FDs like A â€” B, where A is not a super key as long as B is a prime attribute. That is, a proper subset of some candidate key (which means some combination of prime attributes) determining some other (if its same it becomes trivial) prime attribute(s). Reference: https://gatecse.in/demystifying-database-normalization/ Now lets see the options A. Transitive functional dependencies Is possible in 3V F as long as RHS is a prime attribute. B. Non-trivial functional dependencies involving prime attributes on the right-side Possible as explained above. But any attribute(s) determining a prime attribute automatically becomes a prime(s) attribute implying the left-side here must also be (e NEON C. Non-trivial functional dependencies involving prime attributes only on the left-side Not possible in 3N F' D. Non-trivial functional dependencies involving only prime attributes This is possible and infact same as option B as explained for option B. Correct Answer: A;B;D","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
