Which of the following statementsis/are correct? (a) It ensures that two nodes that experience a collision in a time slot will never collide with each other whenthey each retry that packet. (b) It ensures that two or more nodes that experience a collision in a time slot will experience a lower probability of colliding with each other when they each retry that packet. (c) It can be used with slotted Aloha but not with carrier sense multiple access. (d) Over short time scales, it improves the fairness of the throughput achieved by different nodes compared tonot using the mechanism.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
