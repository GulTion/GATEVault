A block pointer is P = 6 bytes long, and a record pointer is PR = 7 bytes long. A file has r = 30,000 EMPLOYEE records of fixed length. Each record has the following fields: Name (30 bytes),SSN (9 bytes), Department_code (9 bytes), Address (40 Dytes), Phone (10 bytes), Birth_date (8 bytes), Sex (1 byte), Job_code (4 bytes), and Salary (4 bytes, real number). An additional byte is used as a deletion marker.Suppose that the file is not ordered by the key field SSN and we want to construct a B+-tree access structure (index) on Ssn. The number of leaf-level blocks needed if blocks are approximately 69% full is (rounded up for convenience)","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
