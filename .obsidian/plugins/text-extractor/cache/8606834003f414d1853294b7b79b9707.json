Thus, we can say f(n) = 0(h(n)) but we cannot always say h(n) = 0(f(n)). So, (a) is not always true but option (b) is always true. (©) 1 (n) = O (g(n)) and g (n) = w(h()) then f(n) <= c. (g(n)) and g (n) >= c1.(h(n)) h(n) can be O (£(n)). Yes, it can be true. For example: f(n) =1, g(n) = n2and h(n) = n°s () If f(n) = © (f(n) + g()) then g (n) = O (f(m)). Yes, it is also true because when f(n) = © (f(n) + g(n)) then g(n) <=c. f(n).","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
