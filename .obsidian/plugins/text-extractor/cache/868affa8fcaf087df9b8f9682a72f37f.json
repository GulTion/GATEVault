Each cache block store the 64 bytes of data, and the cache is 4-way set associative. Assume that memory word is 8 bytes; address is 32-bit long and byte-addressable memory. Each line there will be overhead of tag bits, a dirty bit per word, a valid bit, and 2 LRU bits. What is the total size (including data and overhead bits) of a single set of this particular cache in Dbits?","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
