A full adder is implemented with two half adders â€˜ and one OR gate. The propagation delay of an XOR gate is twice that of an AND/OR gate. The ' propagation delay of an AND/OR gate is 1.2 microseconds. A 4-bit-ripple-carry binary adder is ) implemented by using four full adders. The total propagation time of this 4-bit binary adder in microsecondsis . gatecse-2015-set2 digital-logic ~ adder normal numerical-answers","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
