P = & a [2] [2] [2] Here p is given the address of a [2] [2] [2]. as only two 2T array are declared So the address of the last element is a [1] [1] [1]. Hence a [2] [2] [2] is not defined. So p will pick garbage value. *q = ***a — Here q is pointing to the starting address of a. if we print *q i will print first element of 3D array. Hence option ‘d’ is correct.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
