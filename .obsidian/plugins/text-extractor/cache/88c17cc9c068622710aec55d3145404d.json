Every internal node other than the root thus has at least d children. If the tree is nonempty, the root must have at least one key. Every node can contain at most 2d - 1 keys. Therefore, an internal node can have at ‘most2d children. We say that a node is full if it contains exactly 2d - 1 keys. (b) True. Height of the tree always increases when root node splits. () True. As the number of keys in a B+ tree of order d increases, 10 cost for searches grows logarithmically with the number of keys. (d)False.
