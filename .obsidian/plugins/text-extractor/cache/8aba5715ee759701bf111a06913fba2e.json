Handle means we are GUARANTEED to reach to start symbol. A-True, because if there is no handle then parser won't reduce. B - True, because if there is a handle then parser will reduce. C- True, A conflict means parser doesnt know handle. SR conflict means parser is confused between shift and reduce, this confusion is because parser doesnt know handle at this stage of parsing.
