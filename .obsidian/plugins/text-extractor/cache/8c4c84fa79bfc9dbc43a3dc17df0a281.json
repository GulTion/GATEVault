This combinational circuit works such that a transition (0-to-1 or 1-to-0) in only one of the inputs always results in a transition at the output (-to-1 or 1-to-0). Initially when input (ABCD) is 0000 the output of circuit is 0. What is the output function F(A, B, C, D) as sum of minterm's form of the circuit? (a) F(4,B,C,D) = 짜m(1,2,4,7,8,10,12,14) (b)F(4,B,C,D) = 짜m(1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15) (c) F(A,B,C,D) = 짜m(1,2,4,7,8,11,13,14) (d)F(4,B,C,D) = 짜m(1,2,5,6,9,10,13,14)","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
