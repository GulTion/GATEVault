(a) Address 0x20000000 = (0010 0000 0000 00 | 00 0000 0000 0000 | 0000),, Therefore line number is (00 1000 0000 0000), = 0. (b) Address 0x20000000 = (0010 0000 0000 00 | 00 0000 0000 0000 | 1010),, Therefore line number is (00 1000 0000 0000), = 0, but TAG is same. So, this is not distinct memory blocks that map to the same line 0. (c) Address 0x20048000 = (0010 0000 0000 01 | 00 1000 0000 0000 | 0000),, Therefore line number is (00 1000 0000 0000), = 2048 and TAG is different. So, this is distinct memory blocks that map to the line 2048. (d) Address 0x2004000A = (0010 0000 0000 01 | 00 0000 0000 0000 | 1010),, Therefore line number is (00 0000 0000 0000), = 0 and TAG is different So, this is distinct memory blocks but that map to the same line 0.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
