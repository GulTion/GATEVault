So, decomposition of (4, B,C, D) into (A, B, C)(B, D) s lossless. Best e Thus the given decomposition is lossless. The given decomposition s also dependency preserving as the dependencies A — Bis present in (4, B), B — C'is presentin (B,C), D — Bis presentin (B, D) and C — D s indirectly present via C — Bin (B, C) and B — Din (B, D). htp://www.sztaki.hu/~fodroczi/dbs/dep-pres-own.pdf","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
