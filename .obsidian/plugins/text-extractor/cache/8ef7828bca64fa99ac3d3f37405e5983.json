After k iterations of Bellman-Ford’s algorithm in a graph with n nodes (1 < k < n - 1), which statement is true about the shortest paths from the source node to every other node? (a) The shortest paths with at most k edges have been found. (b) The shortest paths with at most k — 1 edges have been found. (c) The shortest paths with at most k + 1 edges have been found. (d) The shortest paths for any number of edges can change as the algorithm has not completed.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
