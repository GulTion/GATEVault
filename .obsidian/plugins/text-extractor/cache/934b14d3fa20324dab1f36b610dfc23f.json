The tree then becomes A — B — E — C'. Therefore number of tree edges is 3, that is, (T = 3) . > Now, there is one cycle B — E — C, so, we will get a back edge from C'to B while performing DFS. Hence B = 1. r Now, D becomes disconnected node and it can only contribute in forming cross edge . There are 2 cross edges D — A, D — B. Therefore C' = 2. Answer is Option D.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
