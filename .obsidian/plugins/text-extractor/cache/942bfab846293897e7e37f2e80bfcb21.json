Each main memory access takes 150 ns and TLB lookup takes 30 ns. Each page transfer to/from the disk takes 1000 ns. Assume that the TLB hit ratio is 80%, page fault rate is 1%. Assume that for 30% of the total page faults, a dirty page has to be written back to disk before the required page is read from disk. TLB update time is negligible. The average memory access time in ns (round off to nearest integer) is","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
