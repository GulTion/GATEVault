Only a scheduler process will not interrupt the running process as scheduler process gets called only when no other process is running (preemption if any would have happened before scheduler starts execution). Quote from Wikipedia In the Linux kernel, the scheduler is called after each timer interrupt (that is, quite a few times per second). It determines what process to run next based on a variety of factors, including priority, time already run, etc. The implementation of preemption in other kernels is likely to be similar.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
