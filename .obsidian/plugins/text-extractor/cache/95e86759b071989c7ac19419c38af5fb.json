To check status requires one input-type instruction to read the device status register, plus at least one other instruction to examine the register contents. If the device is ready, one output-type instruction is needed to present data to the device handler. The total is 3 instructions, requiring 4.5 us.","libVersion":"0.2.4","langs":"eng"}
