The pumping length cannot be 2 because the string 11 is in the language and it cannot be pumped. Let s be a string in the language of length at least 3. If s is generated by 0° 17 0° 1%, we can write it as 1Yz, where is the empty string, y is the first symbol of s and 7 is the remainder of s. Breaking s up in this way shows that it can be pumped. If s is generated by 10* 1, we can write it as 1y, where x = 1 and y = 0 and is the remainder of 5. This division gives a way to pump s.","libVersion":"0.2.4","langs":"eng"}
