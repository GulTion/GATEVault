Suppose the sender has a window size of 3 and sends packets 1, 2, 3 at t0. At t1(t1>t0) the receiver ACKsl, 2, 3. At t2(t2>t1) the sender times out and resends 1, 2, 3. At t3the receiver receives the duplicates and re-acknowledges 1, 2, 3. At t4the sender receives the ACKs that the receiver sent at tland advances its window to 4, 5, 6. At t5Sthe sender receives the ACKs 1, 2, 3 the receiver sent at t2. These ACKs are outside its window. (b) True. Same as (a) (c) True. Note that with a window size of 1, SR, GBN, and the alternating-bit protocol are functionally equivalent. The window size of 1 precludes the possibility of out-of-order packets (within the window). (d) True. Same as (b)","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
