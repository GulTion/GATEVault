Consider the situation where the input sequence is between range 1 to 10K and the data is 10, 5, 10K, 5K. (b) It is not a comparison-based sorting. It running time complexity is O(n) with space proportional to the range of data. (c) Counting sort uses a partial hashing to count the occurrence of the data object in O(1). (d) Counting sort can be extended to work for negative inputs also.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
