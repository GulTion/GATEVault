For a directed graph, the absence of back edges with respect to a BFS tree implies that the graph is acyclic. 2. The depth of any DFS tree rooted at a vertex is at least as much as the depth of any BFS tree rooted at the same vertex. 3. There is no edge in an undirected graph that jumps more than one level of any BFS tree of the graph. i 7:%) (@R @(0)1% 1 404 ¥ 31:90) NEV W VAN N (O NW-V @ 51§ ¥ 2(@g 4 824 ) Page 74 4.
