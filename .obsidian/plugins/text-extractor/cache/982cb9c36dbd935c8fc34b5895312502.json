{"path":"ONEMONTH/FULL TOPIC/media/Pasted image 20240110103144.png","text":"- Another quick approach of solving this question for keen observers :- Observe that aa or bb is minimal string that is possible in first Regular Expression (a+b)*(aa + bb)(a + b)*. (A) We can have ba or ab as minimal strings which is not possible in (a+b)*(aa + bb)(a + b)* (B) We can have empty string, which is not possible in (a + b)*(aa + bb)(a + b)*. (D) Minimum string length is 3, aa or bb is not possible in this RE. This rules out options A, B and D. So, option C must be the answer.","libVersion":"0.2.4","langs":"eng"}
