Further suppose our hashing scheme uses h 1 for the odd keys and h 2 for the even keys. What is the expected number of keys in a slot? e m/n J n/m 8 2n/m @ n/2m Question 2 Explanation: For n keys and m elements without any condition the expected number of elements inaslot are n/m. How? For 1st element the probability of key1 ends up in slot 1is 1/m. For 2nd element the probability of key2 ends up in slot 2 is 1/m For nth element the probability of keyn ends up in slot nis 1/m Hence expected number of elements in a slot is: 1/m+1/m+... (n times)= n/m In the given question h1 is for elements at even sequence position and h2 is for odd number of sequence positions. This will not affect the overall probability. Hence here also it is n/m","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
