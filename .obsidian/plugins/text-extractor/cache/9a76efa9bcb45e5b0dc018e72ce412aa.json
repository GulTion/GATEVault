Assume that the caches use the write-back policy and all the caches are direct mapped caches. Assume that the dirty bit is always 1 for all the blocks in the caches. In execution of a program, 60% of memory operations are for instruction fetch and 40% of memory operations are for the load and store instructions. Assume that on an average an instruction take 1 cycle of CPU for execution. What is the overall CPI of the processor, assuming everything else is working perfectly.
