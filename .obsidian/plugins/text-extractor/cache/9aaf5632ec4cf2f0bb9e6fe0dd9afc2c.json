By Master’s method we can say that T(n) = ©(n). Given that for n = 40, time = 10 sec Therefore, if n = 80 then Approximate time = i% X 80 = 20 sec. Second method: The function calls itself twice half each time and since it has no loop the function itself has a complexity of O (1) :T(n)z2T(§)+1 nlog,b=n =>T(m)=6(n) 40 _ 80 _, 20 _80 10 x = x=20s","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
