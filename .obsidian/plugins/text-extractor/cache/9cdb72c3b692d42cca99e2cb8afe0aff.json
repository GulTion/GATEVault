Then the next process has to be scheduled by CPU scheduler. e When a particular process finishes its allocated time the next process from the Ready Queue is scheduled by CPU scheduler. e When the process is swapped out of the main memory, the process that is ready for execution is swapped in main memory for execution by CPU scheduler.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
