All other nodes would have ceil(m/2) children, and ceil(m/2) — 1 keys. For convenience, let ¢ = ceil (m/2). In the below formula, h is number of levels. 1 node 1 key at level 1 2 nodes 2 * (c-1) keys at level 2 2%c nodes 2 * ¢ * (c-1) keys at level 3 2*c**2 nodes 2 * ¢**2 * (c-1) keys at level 4 2*c**(h-2) nodes 2 * ¢**(h-2)*(c-1) keys at level h 2 * [c**(h-1)-1] + 1 = 2 * ¢**(h-1) - 1 keys total Since, given height is 5 so number of level is 6, So, putting the values, we get 485 keys total for minimum.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
