Given that data transfer rate from disk is 100 Mb/sec, and total data to transfer is 10000 bytes or 80000 bits So, to transfer data disk takes 100 Mb is 1 sec. So, 80000 bits in 800 microseconds Percentage of processor time consumed for the transfer operation is Data transfer time/(Data transfer time + Initiate and complete) 800/800 + 1500 = 34.78.","libVersion":"0.2.4","langs":"eng"}
