(b) If f{(n) =n and g(n) =1/n then f(n) * g(n) =1 # w(f(n) + g(n)) So, it is false. (c) It is false when f(n) = 2n and g(n) = n. (d) It is always true because o(g(n)) contains all the functions whose growth is strictly less than g(n). While o(g(n)) contains all the functions whose growth is strictly greater than g(n). So, their intersection is &.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
