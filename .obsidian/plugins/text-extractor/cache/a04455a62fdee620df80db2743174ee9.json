There are two RAW dependences in the code sequence: (i) Between LOAD and SUB instructions due to register R1 (forwarding happens from the output of MEM2 stage to the input of EX1 stage), (i) Between SUB and STORE instructions for register R6 (forwarding happens from the output of EX2 stage to the input of EX1 stage).

The clock period for the 10-stage pipeline is 1.1 ns. Therefore: Execution time in nanoseconds = Clock period in nanoseconds * Number of cycles =11+16=17.6ns","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
