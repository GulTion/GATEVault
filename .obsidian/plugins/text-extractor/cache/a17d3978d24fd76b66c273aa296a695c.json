Â« The second 3 GHz machine resolves branches in the EX stage and uses a predict-not-taken scheme. Assume that the cycle times of the machines are identical. Given that 35% of the instructions are branches, 25% of branches are taken, and that stalls are due to branches alone. Which one of the following statements is TRUE? (2) The first machine is 36.60% faster than the second machine. (b) The second machine is 36.60% faster than the first machine. (2) The first machine is 9.81% faster than the second machine. (b) The second machine is 9.81% faster than the first machine.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
