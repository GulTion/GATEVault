Now fcrsecc%aﬂest ‘we must take V=4. Let be the no of faces and every face is bounded by 3 edges so E= 3R but every edges is the part of two faces so E = 3R/2 By Euler formula for planner connected graph: V-E+R=2 4-E+2E/3=2 E=6 Size of graph = 6 In this graph, every face is bounded by exactly 3 edges.
