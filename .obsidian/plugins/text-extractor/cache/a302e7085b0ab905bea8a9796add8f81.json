Each main memory access takes 100 ns and TLB lookup takes 20 ns. Each page transfer to/from the disk takes 5000 ns. Assume that the TLB hit ratio is 95%, page fault rate is 10%. Assume that for 20% of the total page faults, a dirty page has to be written back to disk before the required page is read from disk. TLB update time is negligible. The average memory access time in ns (round off to 1 decimal places) is 0 - Q - CE @ - GATE CSE 2020 Operating System","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
