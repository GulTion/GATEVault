One decomposition is definitely BCNF, the other is definitely 3NF, but it is not known which is which. To make a guaranteed identification, which one of the following tests should be used on the decompositions? (Assume that the closures of F and G are available). (a) Dependency-preservation (b) Lossless-join (c) BCNF definition (d) 3NF definition Answer: (c) Solution:- Explanation: This is because the relation whose highest normal form is 3NF will fail the BCNF test, but both will pass the 3NF test.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
