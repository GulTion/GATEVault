We have defined certain variable for the proper working of selective repeat protocol: Sw=Sender window side, Rw=Receiver window side, S/=Send window first (oldest) outstanding frame, S,;= Send window next frame to send, Ra=Receiver window next frame expected and m= #bits for sequence number. In a network using the Selective-Repeat protocol with m = 4 and the sending window of size 8, the value of variables are S&= 62, S, = 67, and R, = 64. Packet 65 has already been acknowledged at the sender site; packets 65 and 66 are received out-of-order at the receiver site. Assume that the network does not duplicate the packets.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
