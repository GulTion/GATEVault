() T (G) is O (| V|2log 2| V) (b)T (G) is © (| V|2log: |V|9) for directed complete graphs (¢) T(G) is O (] V|2loga| V|?) for directed acyclic graphs (d)T(G) is © (|E|2log:| E|) for directed acyclic graphs Answer: (b) and (d) Solution:T (G) = [V|?|E[log:|E|* In case of directed graph there will be linear relation between V and E . We can write E as linear form of V So T(G) = (IV[*IVIlog, V) So T (G) is Q(|V|?|V|log |V %) there option a is false In case of directed complete graph there will be quadratic relation between V and E So T (G) = (IV|*log, V|%) Therefore Option b is true e If directed graph is acyclic then it's a tree Where E=V-1-0v - T (G) =|VIIVlogy [V T (G) =|V|* log, |VI* > (|V|* log |V|2) .Option C is false “For directed acyclic graphs there is a linear relationship between edges and vertices L T (G) = |V|* log; |V|*Q E?log, E So option (d) is true.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
