Total 32 exponent value. Mantissa have 4 bit it can be 2+ different values ie 16. So total number possible = 32*16 =512. But exponent all zero and mantissa on zero represent de normalised number therefore it should be eliminated also exponent all zero and mantissa all zero must be eliminated also exponent all ones must be eliminated. 512-16-16 =480","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
