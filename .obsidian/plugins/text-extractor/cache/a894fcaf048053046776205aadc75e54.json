The computer system polls the keyboard every 10 ms (milli seconds) to check for a keystroke and consumes 100 ps (micro seconds) for each poll. If it is determined after polling that a key has been pressed, the system consumes an additional 200 ps to process the keystroke. Let T denote the fraction of a second spent in polling and processing a keystroke. In an alternative implementation, the system uses interrupts instead of polling. An interrupt is raised for every keystroke. It takes a total of 1 ms for servicing an interrupt and processing a keystroke. Let T5 denote the fraction of a second spent in servicing the interrupt and processing a keystroke. The ratio % is . (Rounded off to one decimal place)","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
