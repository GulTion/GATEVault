To be clear \"repeats the access sequence THRICE\" means totally the sequence of page numbers are accessed 4 times though this is not important for the answer here. If we go optimal page replacement algorithm it replaces the page which will be least used in near future. Now we have frame size 20 and reference string is ] 12,...,100,1,2,...,100,1,2,...,100,1,2,...,100 First 20 accesses will cause page faults - the initial pages are no longer used and hence optimal page replacement replaces them first. Now, for page 21, according to reference string page 1 will be used again after 100 and similarly 2 will be used after 1 so, on and so the least likely to be used page in future is page 20. So, for 21%* reference page 20 will be replaced and then for 2274 page reference, page 21 will be replaced and so on which is MOST RECENTLY USED page replacement policy. PS: Even for Most Recently Used page replacement at first all empty (invalid) pages frames are replaced and then only most recently used ones are replaced.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
