It is true that the absence of back edges with respect to a DFS tree ies that the graph is acyclic. However, the same is not true for a BFS tree.

Since all vertices are connected by a path with at edges, and since BFS always finds the path with the fewest edges, the BFS willhave depth L BN DFS tree may have depth up to V 1 (for example, ifva comple )A 3.
