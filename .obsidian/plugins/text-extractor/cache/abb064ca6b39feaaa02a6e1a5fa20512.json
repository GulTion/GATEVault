The second one is of the 32 kB direct mapped cache. The size of an address is 32 bits in both organization. A 2 to 1 multiplexer has latency of 0.7 ns which k bit comparator has latency of k/5 nsec. What is the difference between the hit latencies of both cache organization (i.e. associative hit latency â€” direct mapped hit latency) (in nsec)? o 1.2 e 0.9 G 0.6 o 1.4 VIEW Anwser || COPY || MARK","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
