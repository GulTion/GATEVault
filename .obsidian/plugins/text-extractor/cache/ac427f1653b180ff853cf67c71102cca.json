It always selects the edge with maximum weight and it checks after removing from graph whether G is connected or not. If yes then it will be removed. This process will continue till the smallest edge-weight. So, this algorithm is correct for finding a minimum spanning tree in a connected weighted graph. Since the Algorithms B doesn't select the smallest edge-weight in each iteration, hence it is not always correct. It returns the spanning tree but not necessarily minimum. Algorithms C is correct because in each iteration, after adding the edge in T it checks if there is a cycle then it delete the edge with maximum edge-weight.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
