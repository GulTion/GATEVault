What we use iterative method? Well, the normal iterative method for inorder and rev. Inorder traversal inorder also uses a stack of O (n) in worst case. O (n) is really the best we can do? Short answer no. We can do this in just O (1) space. There is an algorithm known as MORRIS TRAVERSAL that can be modified to do inorder and reverse traversal in O (n) time and O (1) space. # MORRIS TRAVERSAL is not really the part of GATE Syllabus (But you can still read about it or internet) # What actually worth knowing in this question, is that there exists an algorithm which can traverse binary trees in O (n) time and just O (1) space...!!!","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
