S, : There exists a connected simple graph with 6 vertices and 7 edges such that G has an euler circuit. e Only S true e Only S true Correct Option Solution : (b) S, :False Given | V| =6and |E| =5. Assume for contradiction that G has an euler circuit. It means that G must be connected and all vertices must have even degree. Particularly the degree of each vertex must be atleast two since a vertex of degree 0 would cause G to be disconnected. Thus the sum of degree of all the vertices must be atleast 12. However by handshaking theorem we must have Z deg(V)= 2| E | =10, this is a contradiction. oeV So, there is no such graph exists. S, : True Consider the graph G = (V, E) with V = {1, 2, 3,4, 5, 6} and E = {12, 23, 31, 24, 45, 56, 62}. One might arrive at such graph and realize that such a graph must have degree sequence 2,2,2,2,2,4 which leads to the given graph. G Both S} and S, are true Q None of these VIEW Anwser || COPY || MARK","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
