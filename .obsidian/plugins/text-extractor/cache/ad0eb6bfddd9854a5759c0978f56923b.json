After 10 steps, we want to end up at position 0 i.e. current position. We can either move left or right in every step. So, to come back to current position after 10 steps, Out of total 10 steps that we take, we need to take 5 steps left and 5 steps right, in any order of left-right steps. Both L, R have equal probability. So, favourable cases which will take us back to position 0 after 10 steps 10 () Total cases that are possible with 10 steps : 210 (because at every step we can either take LorR) 10 So, Probability of %(10) = 0 : ( 5 )/210","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
