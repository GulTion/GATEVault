Virtual memory provides 1. increased address space for processes 2. memory protection 3. relocation So, when we don't need more address space, even if we get rid of virtual memory, we need hardware support for the other two. Without hardware support for memory protection and relocation, we can design a system (by either doing them in software or by partitioning the memory for different users) but those are highly inefficient mechanisms. i.e., there we have to divide the physical memory equally among all users and this limits the memory usage per user and also restricts the maximum number of users.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
