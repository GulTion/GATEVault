Let's count how many permutations : contain at least one of the strings fish, rat, or bird. Denote by A, B, C, the sets of permutations which contain fish, rat, or bird, respectively. One may treat a word like fish as a block, and then there are 22 other letters, therefore |A| = 23. Similarly, |B| = 24!, and |C| = 23!. We apply inclusion-exclusion to compute [AUBUC|=|A|+|B|+|C|—|[ANB|—-|]ANC|—BNC|+|ANBN Now A N C = (), because the letter i would have to appear twice, and also BN C = 0, because of the letter . (This implies A N B N C = () as well.) Then |A N B| = 21!, because we treat fish, rat as two blocks, and there are 19 other letters. In conclusion |A UB U C| = 24! + 2 - 23! — 21!. What we want is the complement, so the answer is 26! — 24! — 2. 23! + 21!","libVersion":"0.2.4","langs":"eng"}
