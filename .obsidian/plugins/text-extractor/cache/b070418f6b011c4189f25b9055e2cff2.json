The device transfers 2 bytes of data in every 0.02 milliseconds. The code to process 2 bytes of data and store it in a memory takes 2000 cycles. If the processor detects that 2 bytes of data is ready through polling, and a polling iteration takes 100 cycles, how many cycles does the entire operation takes if the processor perform polling after ever 500 cycles?","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
