Processor word length is 64 bits. Machine cycle time is 2 psec. Percentage of CPU time is consumed for the DMA operation is (in %). 9 20 Correct Option Solution : (a) X : Preparation time 1MB — 1 sec 64B —? X = 64 usec Y : Transfer time Word length = 64 bits = 8 bytes Data size = 64 bytes = 8 words Machine cycle time = 2 usec Transfer time = 8 x 2 pusec . .
