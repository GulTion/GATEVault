How many candidate keys are possible in R?_ Answer :- 3 Solution: AB—-C, CD-E, C—A, C-D,D-B So candidate key’s. {C}*= {CADBE} = {ABCDE} So Cis candidate key. {AB}* = {ABCDE} so AB is candidate key. {AD}*= {ABCDE} = so AD is candidate key. So only 3 candidate key is AB, C, AD. Answer: 3","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
