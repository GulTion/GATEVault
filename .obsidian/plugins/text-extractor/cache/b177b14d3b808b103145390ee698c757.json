If p is a pumping length for language A, so is any length p' > p. The minimum pumping length for A is the smallest p that is a pumping length for A. What will be the minimum pumping length for the regular expression 0* 1 0* 1* v 1 0* 1? Q' - 0\" (0 Iy VIEW Anwser || COPY || MARK","libVersion":"0.2.4","langs":"eng"}
