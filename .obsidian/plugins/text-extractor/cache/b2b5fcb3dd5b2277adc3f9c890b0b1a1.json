Following is the detailed process that uses Heap. (1) Create a Min Heap of size k+1 with first k+1 elements. This will take Q(k) time. (2) One by one remove min element from heap, put it in result array, and add a new element to heap from remaining elements. Removing an element and adding a new element to min heap will take logy(k) time. So overall complexity will be Q(k) + O ((n â€” k) logok).","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
