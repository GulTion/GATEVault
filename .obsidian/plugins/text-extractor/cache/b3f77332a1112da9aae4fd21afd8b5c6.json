Every time a process is scheduled, the OS runs the process for a maximum of 10 milliseconds or until the process blocks or terminates itself before 10 milliseconds. Subsequently, the OS moves on to the next ready process in the list of processes in a round- robin fashion. Which of the following statements is/are true about this scheduling policy? (a) This policy cannot be efficiently implemented without hardware support for timer interrupts. (b) This scheduler is an example of a non-preemptive scheduling policy. (c) This scheduling policy can sometimes result in involuntary context switches. (d) This scheduling policy prioritizes processes with shorter CPU burst times over processes that run for long durations.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
