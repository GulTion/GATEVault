Suppose that frames are 1000 bits long. Find the maximum throughput of the system in frames/second. Solution: Maximum throughput for ALOHA = (%4)eâ„¢! = 0.1839 Maximum throughput in frames/sec = (56000 bits/sec) x (1 frame/1000 bits) x 0.184 = 10.304 The maximum throughput is approximately 10 frames/sec.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
