Assume that interrupt processing takes about 100 microseconds (i.e., the time to jump to the interrupt service routine (ISR), execute it, and return to the main program). What fraction of processor time (in %) is consumed by this I/O device if it interrupts for every 2 bytes?","libVersion":"0.2.4","langs":"eng"}
