Whenever there is cache miss it takes 10 cycles to send the address from the cache to main memory, 40 cycles to access a block in main memory; and an additional 25 cycles to send a word of data back from memory to the cache. The memory bus width is 1 word. Assume 25% of all instructions are data loads and stores. Assume there is no I-cache miss for instructions. If all data loads and stores hit in the cache, the CPl for the processor is 2. What is the Average CPI of processor considering cache miss?)
