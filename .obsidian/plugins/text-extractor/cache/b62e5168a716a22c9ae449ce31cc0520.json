Each page table entry is of size 4 bytes. A three level page table is used for virtual to physical address 9 translation, where the virtual address is used as follows: > Bits 30 — 31 are used to index into the first level page table. Bits 21 — 29 are used to index into the 2nd level page table. Bits 12 — 20 are used to index into the 3rd level page table. « Bits 0 — 11 are used as offset within the page. The number of bits required for addressing the next level page table(or page frame) in the page table entry of the first, second and third level page tables are respectively A.20,20,20 B.24,24,24 C.24,24,20 D.25,25,24 gatecse-2008 operating-system virtual-memory normal","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
