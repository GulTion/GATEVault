(b) False; o (cyclic group) = o (its generator) (c) G is a group of order k and k is a prime no. implies G is cyclic is true, But order of a cyclic group can also be non - prime, The phrase “if and only if” makes this statement False. (d) Not necessarily always true. It may be true in some cases. Example: Consider a cyclic group {0, 1, 2, 3} under the operation addition modulo 4. Here it is generator as; 11 =1,12=2,13=3,1¢=0, {Itis capable of generating all elements of the group} But 1k = 1¢ = 0 is not a generator for this group.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
