Option (b): If we swap T2 unlock (A) with T lock S (B) it will not make schedule in 2PL T1 can't take X (A) after unlock (B) after unlock shrinking phase started so transaction cannot acquire lock. Option (c): It will also not make schedule in 2PL because the operation T1 Lock â€” X (A) will not be compatible with T2 lock- S (A). Option (d): It is correct.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
