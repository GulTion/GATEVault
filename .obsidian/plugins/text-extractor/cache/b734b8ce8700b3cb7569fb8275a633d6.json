The remainder on dividing 10011101000 by 1001 is 100. So, the actual bit string transmitted is 10011101100. The received bit stream with an error in the third bit from the left is 10111101100. Dividing this by 1001 produces a remainder of 100, which is different from 0. Thus, the receiver detects the error and can ask for a retransmission. If the transmitted bit stream is converted to any multiple of 1001, the error will not be detected. A trivial example is if all ones in the bit stream are inverted to zeros. 10001100 Receiver will do the 1001_v10011101000 same operation 1001 00001101 10001100 1001 1001_v10011101100 01000 1001 1001 00001101 000100 1001 } ; 01001 transmitter will send 1001 10011101100 000000 The code is correct","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
