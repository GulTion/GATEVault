In slow start, each incoming new ACK increments the congestion window by the maximum segment size. Suppose the sender previously received cumulative ACK 135801 (i.e., the receiver says it got all bytes sent to it, up to and including, sequence number 135800) which makes the current TCP window 28000 byte. The sender next receives cumulative ACK 138601. Assuming the sender is in slow start and has enough data in it transmit socket buffer so the new current TCP window size in byte is (a) 30800 (b) 30400 (c) 29400 (d) 28000","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
