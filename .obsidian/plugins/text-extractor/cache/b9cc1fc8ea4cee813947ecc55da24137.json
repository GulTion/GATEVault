Height 8 means total 9 levels, let's denote number of levels by h. So, h = 9. Fora B tree with h levels of index, where b is maximum number of children per node : « The maximum number of records stored is Tuyay = b — b1 h-1 h-2 « The minimum number of records stored is Npin = 2 [%] -2 [%] So, just put the values, b = 5, h = 9, So, we get 8748 records stored.
