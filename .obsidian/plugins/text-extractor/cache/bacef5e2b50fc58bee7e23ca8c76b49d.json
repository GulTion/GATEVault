Then, one way to compute this is iteratively: If there are 1429 blocks in the first level of the tree (leaf), there must be 1429 block pointers in the second level. So there are [1429 / 23] = 63 blocks in the second level. Similarly, [63 / 231 = 3 blocks in the third level, and clearly 1 block in the BASIC DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM Page 8 fourth level. So x = 4. Alternatively, use the logarithmic-height formula: x = [logw(b)] + 1 = [(logzs(1429) 1+ 1 = 4.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
