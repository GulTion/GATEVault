Assume that the table size is 23. Then the address returned by probe 1 in the probe sequence (assume that the probe sequence begins at probe 0) for key value k=90 is 5 o Question 1 Explanation: - Probe sequence is the list of locations which a method for open addressing produces as alternatives in case of a collision. -K=90 +hy(k) = kmod 23 = 90 mod 23 = 21 - In case of collision, we need to use secondary hash function. - hy(k) =1+ (kmodi19) = 1+ 90mod19 = 1+14 = 15 - Now (21+15) mod 23 = 36 mod 23 = 13 - So the address is 13.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
