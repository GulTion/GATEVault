PS: In merge operation we do a comparison of two elements and put one element in the sorted output array. So, every comparison produces one output element. But for the last element we won't need a comparison and we simply insert it to the output array. So for 7 output elements we need (n — 1) ccomparisons.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
