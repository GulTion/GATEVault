That means the 11 bits has be transmitted. So, size of frame is 11 bits. L = 11 bits R = 10Mbps D = ? meters S = 2 x 10° meter/second In CSMA/CD in order to detect collision the for all possible frame transmission, the tx must be greater than equal to 2tp. Therefore tx >= 2tp L/R=2D/S L xS 2’ P 2R D =< 110 meter","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
