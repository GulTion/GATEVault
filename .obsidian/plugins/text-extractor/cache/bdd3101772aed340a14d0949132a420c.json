Which of the statement below is true with respect to the above scenario? e Receiver is absolutely sure that no bit errors have occurred. If the receiver is TCP instead of UDP, the receiver is still absolutely sure that no bit errors have occurred. UDP receiver is absolutely sure about no error. But if it’s a TCP receiver it won’t be. e Both TCP and UDP receivers will not be absolutely sure about error. Correct Option Solution : @ UDP receiver can’t be absolutely sure that no bit errors have occurred. Because as per the checksum calculation mechanism, if the corresponding bits of two 16 bit words in the packet were 0 and 1, then even if these get flipped to 1 and 0 respectively, the sum still remains the same. Hence the 1’s complement, the receiver calculate is also same. Hence, checksum gets verified, even when there was actually an error during transmission. TCP also uses the same checksum mechanism. Hence the statement will hold true for TCP also. VIEW Anwser || COPY || MARK","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
