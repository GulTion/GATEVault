So number of vertices having odd degrees must be even, otherwise their sum would have been odd, making total degree also odd. Now Single vertex v is connected to all these even number of vertices (which have odd degrees). So degree of v is also even. Moreover, now degree of all vertices which are connected to v is increased by 1, hence vertices which had odd degree earlier now have even degree. So now, all vertices in graph have even degree, which is necessary and sufficient condition for euler graph. So (D) is correct.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
