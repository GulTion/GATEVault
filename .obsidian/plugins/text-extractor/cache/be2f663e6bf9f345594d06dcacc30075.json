Given a string, it produces another string by replacing the first 1 in any subsequence of consecutive 1's by a 0. Consider the following example. Input sequence: 00100011000011100 Output sequence: 00000001000001100 A Mealy Machine is a state machine where both the next state and the output are functions of the present state and the current input. The above mentioned circuit can be designed as a two-state Mealy machine. The states in the Mealy machine can be represented using Boolean values 0 and 1. We denote the current state, the next state, the next incoming bit, and the output bit of the Mealy machine by the variables s, t, b and y respectively. Assume the initial state of the Mealy machine is 0. What are the Boolean expressions corresponding to t and y in terms of s and b? t=s+b y=sb t=b y=sb t=b y=sb t=s+b y=sb","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
