(c) L = {we {a, b}* |wx € Li; xe {a, b}* & complement of L; is regular} L1 is regular, wx is a string of L1 If w =% &x = (a+ b) so this generateall the string over a, b. So this language is regular. wx —> L (a+b)* > (a+b)* (d) L = {ar2| p and q are prime} U {a? | p is prime} Product of two prime numbersis not a prime number but not all composite numbers are product of two prime numbers. So this is not regular because we are not able to write regular expression. :","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
