A block pointer is'PB = 6 bytes long, and a record pointer is PR = 7 bytes long. A file has r = 30,000 EMPLOYEE records of fixed length. The size of each record is 115 bytes. Suppose the file is not ordered by the key field Ssn (9 bytes) and wewant to construct a B+-tree access structure (index) on Ssn. An non-leaf node of the B+-tree can have up to p child pointers and p â€” 1 search key fields; The leaf nodes of the B+-tree can have up to p record pointers, p search key fields and the a next pointer, these must fit into a single block.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
