Assume that 50% of the instructions in P1 are Load/Store instructions and the processor does not use a cache. All the instruction fetch and data read/write requests are served by main â€˜memory with a fixed latency of 6 clock cycles. Assume that also Load/Store instruction uses all the stages of the processor and other instructions uses all the stages except MA stage of the processor. If all the stages other than the IF and MA take 1 clock cycle each, then how long (in seconds) does it take for the processor to complete the program P1?
