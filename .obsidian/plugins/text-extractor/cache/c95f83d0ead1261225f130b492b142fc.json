The last ACK that Alice received from Bob is byte 700, and the last byte that Alice sends to Bob is byte 900. Solution: It the ACK represent byte 700 expected that means Alice send next bytes 700 to 900 that menas 201 bytes, but if the ACK is what is recived, that means Alice send next bytes from 701 to 900, i.e. 200 bytes Can accept 560 — 200 = 360 bytes more or 359 bytes. So can get up to 900 + 360 = 1260. So first byte he will not accept is 1261 or 1260 Q37. | Assuming that Alice doesn’t receive any more ACKs and her window does not change, what is the greatest byte number that Alice can send? Solution: Senderwindow = min (congestion window, advertised flow-control window) = min (536, 560) Thereforesender window is 536 bytes. Already has 200 outstanding. Can send 536-200=336 more. So, the greatest byte number that Alice can send is 900 + 336 = 1236 Answer: 1236","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
