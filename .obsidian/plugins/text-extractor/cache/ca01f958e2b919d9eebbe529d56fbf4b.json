How many super keys are possible in relation R? Answer 120 Solution: CH—G, A->BC, BH-CFH, E—A and FHEG BASIC DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM Page 17 - R=ABCDEFHG) Super keys are there out of these A,B,C,D, E, F, G, Hand out of these candidate keys are AD, BD, FD and ED. Now using AD we have 26 super keys. Same with BD, ED and FD but some super keys are repeating. -To find this we apply principle of inclusion and exclusion. using AD keys = 26 BD=2¢ ED=25 using FD = 26 - Keys using ABD= 27 Keys using BED= 25 Keys using BFD= 25 Keys using AED= 25 Keys using AFD= 25 Keys using EFD = 2° Keys using ABED =24 BEFD= 24 Keys using ABFD=24 AEFD= 24 Keys using ABEFD= 29 - Using principal of inclusion and inclusion AD+BD+FD+ED-ABD-BED-BFD-AED-AFD-EFD+ABED+ABFD+BEFD+AEFD-ABEFD. = 264462544421 .25 =256-192 +64-8 = 320-200 =120 Answer:120","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
