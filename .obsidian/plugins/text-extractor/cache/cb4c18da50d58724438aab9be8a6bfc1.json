A sends the file data in fixed size packets equal to the Maximum Segment Size (MSS), a predetermined value. B sends an acknowledgement immediately upon receiving a data segment. Let R be the round trip time between A and B. The fixed advertised receiver window size of host B for all rounds is Rwna = 3 MSS. Assume that the TCP connection is not established and that the transmission time is negligible. TCP performs the slow start and congestion avoidance mechanisms, and there is no error or packet loss during transmission. Given that initial Coma = 1 MSS and SSueeseia = 4MSS, how long does it take the file to be sent and acknowledged? (@) 4R (b) SR () 6R @ 7R","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
