(b) True; Because R is reflexive, anti - symmetric and transitive. (c) False; Because Hasse - diagram of R is R i o o o 123 So, In hasse diagram of R 1 is not comparable to 2 but for total order relation “every element is comparable to every other element “. Hence option (c) is false. (d) False; Because Hasse-diagram of R, doesn’t have any edge.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
