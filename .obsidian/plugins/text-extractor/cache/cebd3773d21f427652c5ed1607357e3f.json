(a) A cyclic group G with a generator of finite order n then number of different subgroups is equal to the total number of divisors of n. (b) The order of cyclic group need not be same as its generator. (c) Consider a group (G, *) of order k. G is cyclic group if and only if k is prime number. (d) If ‘g’ is generator of the cyclic group of order k, then g* is also a generator of the cyclic group.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
