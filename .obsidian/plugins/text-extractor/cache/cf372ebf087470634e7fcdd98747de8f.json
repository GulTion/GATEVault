(b) It is not distributive lattice, because it is not a lattice [GLB (a, b) doesn’t exist] (c) It is not distributive lattice, because complement of ¢ is b and d (Two complement of ¢) .. Not distributive as theorem says “A lattice L is distributive iff every element has atmost one complement”. (d) It is not distributive Lattice, Because there are 2 complement of h (i.e. e and d) . Ans b, ¢, d doesn’t represent distributive lattice.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
