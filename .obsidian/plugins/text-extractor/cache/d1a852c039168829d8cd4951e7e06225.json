(b) After the merge step. (c) One before and one after the merge step. (d) During the merge step. Answer: A MergeSort(arr[], 1, r) Ifr>1 1. Find the middle point to divide the array into two halves: middle m = 1+ (r-1)/2 2. Call mergeSort for first half: Call mergeSort(arr, 1, m) 3. Call mergeSort for second half: Call mergeSort(arr, m+1, r) 4. Merge the two halves sorted in step 2 and 3: Call merge(arr, 1, m, 1","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
