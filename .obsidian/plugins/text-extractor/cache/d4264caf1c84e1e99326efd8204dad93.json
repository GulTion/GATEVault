There are two links (and one switch) between A and B, and the links are congested (that is, no queuing delays). Host A segments the file into segment of S bytes each and adds 40 bytes of header to each segment, forming packets of L = 40 + S bytes. Each link has a transmission rate of R bytes per seconds. Assume that propagation delay is negligible in both the links. The value of S that minimizes the delay of moving the file from Host A to Host Bis","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
