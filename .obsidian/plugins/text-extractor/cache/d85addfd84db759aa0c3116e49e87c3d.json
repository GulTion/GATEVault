The cache implements a true LRU replacement policy using the minimum number of replacement policy bits necessary to implement it. The tag store requires a total of 2304 bits of storage. Assume that 1 valid bit and 1 dirty bit maintains for each block. What is the block size of the cache? (a) 8 bytes (b) 16 bytes (c) 32 bytes (d) 64 bytes","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
