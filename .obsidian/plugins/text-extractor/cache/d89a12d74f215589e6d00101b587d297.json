Acquiring a non-reentrant lock twice in a row before releasing will result in deadlock within the same thread. (b) False. A thread in a critical section will be context switched when its time quanta expire. I mm——————= process, it find the virtual safe sequence in the system by virtually allocating the request. If it finds that there exists a safe sequence then it allocates that request to process. Otherwise reject that request. So overall at all time system in safe sate. (d) False. If every resource has single instance, then cycle in a resource allocation graph always implies deadlock.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
