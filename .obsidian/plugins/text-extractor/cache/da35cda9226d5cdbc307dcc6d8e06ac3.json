The processor needs to transfer a file of 32 Mbytes from disk to main memory. The memory is byte addressable. The minimum number of times the DMA controller needs to get the control of the system bus from the processor to transfer the file from the disk to main memory is Answer : (512) Solution : Maximum number that can be stored in 16 bits is 216 â€” 1 = 65535 = 64K (approx.) So, up to 64K bytes of data can be transferred by the DMA controller at a time. Number of times DMA controller needs to be invoked = 215K / 64 K= 512","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
