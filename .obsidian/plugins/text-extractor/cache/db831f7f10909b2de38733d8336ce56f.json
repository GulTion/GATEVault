To know the answer let us check all the options: A.L(s) C L(r): strings generated by s are any numbers of 1's followed by one 0, i.e., 10,110, 1110, 1110, . . .. Strings generated by 7 are is 1 followed by any combination ofOorl,ie,1,10,11,1110,101,110.. .. This shows that all the strings that can be generated by s, can also be generated by it means L(s) C L(r) is true. L(s) C L(t): here strings generated by ¢ are any numbers of 1 (here 1* means we ' have strings as €, 1,11, 111, . . .) followed by only one 0, i.e., 0, 10,110, 1110, .. .. So we can see that all the strings that are present in s can also be generated by ¢, hence L(s) C L(t) which shows that option Ais true. B. L(r) C L(s): this is false because string 1 which can be generated by r, cannot be generated by s. C. Same as option A. D. L(t) C L(s): this is false because string 0 which can be generated by ,cannot be generated by s.","libVersion":"0.2.4","langs":"eng"}
