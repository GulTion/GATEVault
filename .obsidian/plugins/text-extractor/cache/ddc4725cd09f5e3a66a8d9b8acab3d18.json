(b) L = {a=b=|n is number of divisors of 10000}, divisors of 10000 is finite {1, 2, 5...10000}, so L generates the finite string. So L is regular. (c) L = fwxwRw |w, X € {a, b}*} fw=2 Then wR= 2 ~.L={.xAA|xefa, by} = (a+ b)* In this case the language generates all the string so this language is regular. (d) L = farb=|n + m > 50 & n, m > O} This language generate the string except sum of n & m less than 50 (n + m > 50) extn+mz>=3","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
