The path from node A to node D passes through 3 links, and 2 intermediate nodes. Each of the links is a 10km optical fiber with a rate of 10 Mbps. The 2 intermediate nodes are [store-and-forward switches â€˜and each intermediate node must perform a 25 psec routing table look up after receiving a complete packet before it can begin sending it on the outgoing link. How long (in msec) does it take to send the entire file across the network? (Assume the propagation speed through optical fiber is 2 x 1078m/ sec).
