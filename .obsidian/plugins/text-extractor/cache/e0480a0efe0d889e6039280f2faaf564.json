This is accomplished by means of a timer alerting the processor every 20 ms. The interface of the device includes two ports: one for status and one for data output. To check status requires one input-type instruction to read the device status register, plus at least one other instruction to examine the register contents. If the device is ready, one output-type instruction is needed to present data to the device handler. How long does (in microseconds) it take to scan and service the device given a clocking rate of 8 MHz? Assume for simplicity that all instruction cycles take 12 clock cycles.","libVersion":"0.2.4","langs":"eng"}
