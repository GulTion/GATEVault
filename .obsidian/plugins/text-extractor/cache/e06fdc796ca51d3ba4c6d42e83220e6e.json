Statement 3 is INCORRECT because OSPF doesnot use a transport protocol such as UDP or TCP but ? encapsulates its data directly into IP Packets. ;1!, Statement 4 is CORRECT because OSPF is a routing protocol which uses Link State Routing(LSR) and works within a single Autonomous System. PS: OSPF needs to perform reliable multicasting because it needs to talk to multiple possible neighbors on the same network segment. Now, TCP does not support multicast and UDP is not reliable Therefore, OSPF implements its own transport mechanism that allows both for reliability (acknowledgements and retransmissions of lost segments) and multicasting, bypassing both TCP and UDP. Hence, Option C is CORRECT.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
