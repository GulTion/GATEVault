Hence, 1 is False. 2. Video Solution is Here: https://youtu.be/-50Rbrk3MMM?t=3915 3. The set of all Prime numbers is Countable (because it is a subset of the set of natural numbers) & there is bijection between the set of all primes & set in option 3. Hence, Option 3 set is countable. 4. Every infinite set S has bijection with S-{a} where \"a\" is one element in S. (This is Not true if S is a finite set). So, Option 4 is True. Find Video Solution Below for Option 4: https://youtu.be/3zom7viY2A0?t=1219 Learn Countability with Proof here to understand it & handle any variation from it: Countability Playlist","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
