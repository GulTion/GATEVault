So, on an average time lost due to page fault per instruction=% = 800ns Now, to this compute Memory access time using TLB. EMAT = 0.9(150) + 0.1(3 * 150) = 180ns Since, 2 Memory References are made, Hence total time=360ns To this, 100ns of cpu time. effective average instruction execution time=800 + 360 + 100 = 1260ns","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
