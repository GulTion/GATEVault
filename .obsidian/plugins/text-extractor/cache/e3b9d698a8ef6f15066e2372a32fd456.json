To reach the destination, the route goes through three networks, A, B, and C. Network A is the one where the sender is directly connected, and Network C is where the receiver is directly connected. Network A has an MTU of 5000 bytes. Network B has an MTU of 3000 bytes. Network C has an MTU of 1000 bytes. Assume that there is no other traffic and no congestion in the network, also network does not re-order the packets. Which of the following statement(s) is/are TRUE about this network? (a) The total number of fragments received by the receiver is 10. (b) The total length of last fragment received by the receiver is 52 bytes (c) The fragment offset of the last packet received by the receiver is 866 (d) the total number of bytes received by the transport layer of receiver is 7200 bytes","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
