Case I: If TM Go for loop forever any state them that TM will accepted Case II: If TM doesnâ€™t go for loop forever then we can ensure this (because TM has finite mummer of states) So it is decidable. This option is true. (A) Since head of TM move only in right direction then it will accept fegular. But not every RE is regular. Thus it is false. (B) It is decidable because length of w is finite. It is true.","libVersion":"0.2.4","langs":"eng"}
