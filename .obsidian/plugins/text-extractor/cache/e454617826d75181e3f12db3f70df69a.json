Hence (Zs, +) is Abelian also. But (Z, *) is not Abelian group. As 0 is identity of first operation and it won’t be part of set for second operation and you can observe form table that (2 © 2 = 0). Due to this (2 © 2 = 0) itis not integral domain. Also, 1 *2=3*2but 1 3. Since (Za, *) is associative because 1*(2*3)=1*2=2,and (1*2)*3=2*3=2 2*(3*2) =2*2=0and (2*3)*2=2*2 = 0. And so on. Since It is Ring.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
