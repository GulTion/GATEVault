Suppose three active nodes - nodes A, B, and C- are competing for access to a channel. Assume that, time is divided into slots and each node has an infinite number of packets to send. Each node attempts to transmit in each slot with probability p. The first slot is numbered slot 1, the second slot is numbered slot 2, and so on. Answer the following questions.
