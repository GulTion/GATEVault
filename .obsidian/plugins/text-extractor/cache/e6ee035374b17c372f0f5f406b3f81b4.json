Time taken to empty token bucket of 1 MB is % i.e 0.1 sec. Data send in this time is 0.1 * 20 = 2 MB (rate at which bucket is emptying is different from rate at which data is send) . Data leftto sendis 12 — 2 = 10 MB . Now bucket is empty and rate of token arriving is less than that of going out so effective data speed will be 10MBps. Time to send remaining 10MB will be 1 sec. So total timeis 1 4 0.1=1.1sec","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
