So, to avoid first 3 slots, the hash function has to pick from the remaining 97 slots. And repetition is allowed, since chaining is used- meaning a list of elements are stored in a slot and not a single element. So, required probability = % X % X % = (97 x 97 x 97)/100% Correct Answer: A B","libVersion":"0.2.4","langs":"eng"}
