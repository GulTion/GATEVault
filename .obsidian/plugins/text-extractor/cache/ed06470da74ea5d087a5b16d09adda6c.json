Note that the arrival of C does not preempt B because it has a shorter remaining time. C completes at 11. B is not ready yet, so A runs for another 4 units and completes at 15. Note that the completion of B's 1/O does not preempt A because Aâ€™s remaining time is shorter. B finally restarts at 15 and completes at 20.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
