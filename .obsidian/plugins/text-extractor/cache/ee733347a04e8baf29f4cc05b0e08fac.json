The normal data inputs to a flip flop are referred to as synchronous inputs because they have effect on the outputs (Q and Q) only in step, or in sync, with the clock signal transitions. The extra inputs are called asynchronous because they can set or reset the flip- flop regardless of the status of the clock signal. Typically, they are called preset and clear. When the preset input is activated, the flip-flop will be set (Q = 1, Q = 0) regardless of any of the synchronous inputs or the clock. When the clear input is activated, the flip-flop will be reset (Q = 0, Q = 1), regardless of any of the synchronous inputs or the clock. Assume that initially Preset is active high. Preset [ J Q r.
