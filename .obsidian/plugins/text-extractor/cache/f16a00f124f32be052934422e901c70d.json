(a) Insertion sort (b)Selection sort (c)Quick sort (d)Bubble sort Solution: Selection sort pays the least attention to the ordering of the elements in the input list. Because its best case, average case and worst case complexity are same. Remaining three sorting algorithms has different best case and worst case complexity, because their complexity depends on the ordering of the element in the input list.
