Example : Let P=3 ; Q=5 Since J is a proper subgroup of (Z, +), So, J contains identity element i.e. 0; If J contains P = 3; then J also has to contain P + P = 2P = 6; P+P+P=3P=9; P+P+P+P+P=5P=PQ=15 P+P+... (PQ’1 times ) = P?, etc. NOTE : If J contains both P, Q then J would also contain P+Q ; P%; Q% PQetc. BUT Since it is given that Exactly 3 elements from {p, p + ¢, pg, p?, ¢*}; Option C is correct. NOTE : Since J is proper subgroup of (Z, +) hence, either J is infinite set OR J ={0}.","libVersion":"0.2.4","langs":"eng"}
