Time to transfer one page to/from disk: 5000 ns y 4. TLB hit ratio: 0.95 5. Page fault rate: 0.10 3 6.20 % of page faults needs to be written back to disk er Hence, effective memory access time = 0.95(20 + 100) + 0.05{0.90(20 + 100 + 100) + 0.10[0.80(20 + 100 + 5000 + 100) + 0.20(20 + 100 + 5000 + 5000 + 100)]} = 155.0ns Explanation: If there is a TLB hit, you just need to access the memory. If there is a miss 1 TLB lookup was wasted, 1. You need to lookup the page table for the entry and then access the required location, requiring 2 memory accesses - Assuming No Page fault oceurs. 2. If there is a page fault, Then 1 memory access was wasted (you can only know that the page is not present in memory by checking the corresponding page entry in the page table). 80 % of the time, you'll only be fetching a page from secondary storage which takes 5000 ns, 20% of the time, you'll need to write a dirty page back to disk and bring the page (which caused the page fault) back to main memory, requiring 5000 + 5000 ns","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
