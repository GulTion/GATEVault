Extract_min () - It delete the vertex with shortest distance from source vertex one by one. So, we have to call this function n time. Decrease_key () - After edge relaxation decrease_key() function is called. In Dijkstra’s we know that every edge is relaxed once. So, this function will be called ‘m’ times. _Option (b) is correct.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
