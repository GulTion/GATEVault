It has 500 sectors per track and each sector can store 500 bytes of data. Consider a file stored in the disk. The file contains 1000 sectors. Assume that every sector access necessitates a seek, and the average rotational latency for accessing each sector is half of the time for one complete rotation. The total time (in milliseconds) needed to read the entire file is .","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
