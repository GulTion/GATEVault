So none of the digits can + be zero. Recipe: Choose 4 distinct digits out of {1,2, 3, 4,5, 6, 7, 8,9} and arrange them in increasing order. Once we choose 4 digits out of {1,2, 3,4,5,6, 7, 8,9}, we have exactly one way to put them in strictly increasing order. For example, if you select 6, 4, 8, 2 from the set {1, 2, 3,4,5,6, 7, 8,9}, then we can only make one strictly increasing order from these, that is 2468.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
