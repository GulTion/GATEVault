Then sufficient condition for ensuring that deadlock does not occur is (c). OPTION A is not true. Here m is total number of resources available. So, if option a is satisfied, it does not ensure deadlock free. But if option a is not satisfied, surely there is a possibility of deadlock. Since if all m resources are allocated to Pi and it still needs resources, then all processes along with Pi are waiting for resources and thus blocked.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
