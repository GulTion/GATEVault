It has all the properties of IEEE 754 (e.g.,£0, +, NAN, Denormalized number). There is a sign bit in the most significant bit. The next five bits are the two’s complement exponent. The last 4 bits is the normalized fraction. How many positive normalized floating-point numbers can be represented?","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
