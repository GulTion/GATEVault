So, T1 = Total Time consumed In polling + Time consumed In processing of keystroke =10000 microsec + 200 microsec = 10200 microsec or 10.2 millisec. T1=10.2ms. For T2 : Fraction of a second spent in servicing the interrupt and processing a keystroke. In alternative implementation system is taking total 1 ms for servicing the interrupt & processing the keystroke. S0, T2=1ms. Now, T1/T2=10.2ms/1ms=10.2. So, Answer will be 10.2.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
