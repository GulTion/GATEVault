Suppose 5 packets, each of size 200 bytes, are sent over the connection from Host A to Host B. Consider the following two statements about the TCP communication: S1: If Host B sends back a packet with the ACK field set to 601, then only the first three packets have made it through to Host B. S2: If Host B sends back a packet with the ACK field set to 401, then the first two packets have made it through to Host B. Which of the above two statements is/are TRUE? (a) S1 only (b) S2 only (c) Both S1 and S2 (d) Neither S1 nor S2","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
