(a) The TTL field is decremented at each DNS server that the response passes through on its way to the client, and servers drop responses with a TTL of 0, so the TTL field prevents responses from looping indefinitely. (b) The TTL field allows DNS servers to prevent cache poisoning. (c) The TTL field is necessary for scalability: if DNS servers could never time out entries, over time they would accumulate infinite state. (d) The TTL field causes DNS servers to delete entries after some time, so that if the host moves and the underlying address changes, the server will eventually get the correct address.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
