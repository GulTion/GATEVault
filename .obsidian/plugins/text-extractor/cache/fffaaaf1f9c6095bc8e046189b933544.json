In this variant, the leaves contain the records themselves, not pointers to the records. A leaf can contain as many records as will it in a block (allowing for a sequence pointer). Non-leaf nodes are also one block in size, and contain as many keys (and appropriate pointers) as will fit. Assume that each blocks size is 4096 bytes, each record is 300 bytes long, block pointer is 10 bytes, record pointer is 12 bytes, search key is 8 bytes long and Un-spanned organization is used. If the heap file has 1,000,000 records, how many minimum blocks will this B--tree use for indexing?","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
