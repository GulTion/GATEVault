## **Switching Techniques-**

[ICT | Information and Communication Technology - Introduction](https://humix.com/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Feducom360.com%2Fhumix%2Fvideo%2FE5GIsRqAjz2)

Various switching techniques are-

1. Circuit Switching
2. Message Switching
3. Packet Switching

In this article, we will discuss about Circuit Switching.

## **Circuit Switching-**

This switching technique operates in the following three phases-

1. Establishing a circuit
2. Transferring the data
3. Disconnecting the circuit

### **1. Establishing A Circuit-**

In this phase,

- A circuit is established between the two ends.
- Circuit provides a dedicated path for data to travel from one to the other end.
- Resources are reserved at intermediate switches which are used during the transmission.
- The intermediate switches are connected by the physical links.

### **2. Transferring The Data-**

After the circuit is established,

- The entire data travels over the dedicated path from one end to the other end.

### **3. Disconnecting The Circuit-**

After the data transfer is completed,

- The circuit is torn down i.e. disconnected.

## **Total Time-**

**Total time taken to transmit a message in circuit switched network** = 
<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Connection set up time</mark> + <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Transmission delay</mark> + <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Propagation delay </mark>+ <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Tear down time</mark>


where-

- Transmission delay = Message size / Bandwidth
<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">- Propagation delay = (Number of hops on way x Distance between 2 hops) / Propagation speed</mark>


## **Advantages-**

Circuit switching has the following advantages-

- A well defined and dedicated path exists for the data to travel.
- There is no header overhead.
- There is no waiting time at any switch and the data is transmitted without any delay.
- Data always reaches the other end in order.
- No re ordering is required.

## **Disadvantages-**

Circuit switching has the following disadvantages-

- The channel is blocked for two ends only.
- It is inefficient in terms of utilization of system resources.
- The time required for establishing the circuit between the two ends is too long.
- Dedicated channels require more bandwidth.
- It is more expensive than other switching techniques.
- Routing decisions can not be changed once the circuit is established.

## **Important Notes-**

- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Circuit switching is implemented at physical layer.</mark>
- Circuit switching is now outdated.
