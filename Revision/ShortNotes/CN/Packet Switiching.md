## **Packet Switching-

In packet switching,

- The entire message to be sent is divided into multiple smaller size packets.
- This process of dividing a single message into smaller size packets is called asÂ **packetization**.
- These smaller packets are sent after the other.
- It gives the advantage of pipelining and reduces the total time taken to transmit the message.

## **Optimal Packet Size-**

If the packet size is not chosen wisely, then-

- It may result in adverse effects.
- It might increase the time taken to transmit the message.

So, it is very important to choose the packet size wisely.
